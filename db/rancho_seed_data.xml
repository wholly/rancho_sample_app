<body>Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation (RIOC) President Steve Shane, Chief Financial Officer Steve Chironis and VP Of Operations Fernando Martinez were all busy last night making presentations to members of the Roosevelt Island community.The first up was Mr. Martinez. He was invited by Related Management to speak on the transportation changes planned for Roosevelt Island following the temporary shutdown of the Tram during it's Modernization Program. Mr. Martinez spoke before a gathering of Southtown's Riverwalk residents in the rooftop Party Room of Riverwalk Crossings, the new rental building adjacent to the Tram, at 405 Main Street.RIOC's VP Of Operations Fernando Martinez Speaking To Riverwalk ResidentsMr. Martinez explained that the Tram shutdown is scheduled to begin on March 1, last for six months and resume operations in early September. There is a possibility that one of the cabins may be in operation a little earlier, middle of August, but that is not definite. During the tram shutdown, RIOC will be providing Red Bus Shuttle rush hour service to the Queens Plaza subway station every half hour with pick ups at Southtown and Gristedes stops. During non-rush hour week days and weekends, there will be Red Bus Shuttle service to Second Avenue in Manhattan. Here is more information on RIOC's plan for Red Bus shuttle service from earlier post.Mr. Martinez also talked about the results of the survey seeking residents interest in a temporary rush hour ferry service during the Tram Outage. The survey results were still being tabulated but of the approximately 1000 responses received, about 50% were in favor of the service and of those 50%, 30% (150) said they would pay the projected fare of $3 and find the route useful for their commute. The projected cost of the temporary ferry service is said by the Operator to be $5,000 per day. Do the math - even with a proposed $100,000 subsidy from RIOC - the economics don't seem to work unless RIOC (or some other entity) is willing to subsidize the service to a much larger dollar amount.Residents attending the meeting asked questions about increased F Train subway service during the tram outage and Mr. Martinez explained that RIOC has been meeting with the MTA but that no additional subway service is to be expected. More detail on the MTA's response to Roosevelt Island residents request for increased subway service is available from this earlier post. One new Roosevelt Island resident recounted a conversation she had with an MTA official about the problems she would encounter getting to her doctor with the Tram Outage. She was told by the MTA official that she should have done more research about Roosevelt Island before moving here.RIOC's Fernando Martinez Answering Residents Questions On Tram ShutdownOther residents were concerned about the qualifications of POMA, the Tram Modernization contractor and whether all of the necessary construction and traffic permitting would be in place prior to the Tram going out of service. Mr. Martinez assured them that POMA was qualified and that all permits would be in place before the Tram was taken out of service.Another resident wanted to know what the tram outage would do to the assesed value of his condominium. The Related representative said she was not an appraiser and could not comment on this issue.`I think all agreed that Mr. Martinez made an excellent presentation. I asked if he has made similar presentations to other Roosevelt Island buildings and he reported that he has met with representatives from all of the Roosevelt Island buildings management but that Related was the  only management company to ask him to speak to their residents.Later in the evening, Mr. Shane and Mr. Chironis appeared before the Roosevelt Island Residents Association (RIRA) Common Council to report on and take questions concerning RIOC's proposed budget for Fiscal Year 2010 -2011.RIOC President Steve Shane Speaking To RIRA On BudgetMr. Shane explained that RIOC is legally required to prepare a 5 year budget but that at the suggestion of RIRA has extended th...</body></row>

<body>You Tube Video of 2007 Manhattan Lego Robotics ChampionshipsRoosevelt Island Residents Association President (RIRA) Frank Farance sends the following report to Roosevelt Island residents.1.  Routing of Buses and Main Street in Southtown area.  As reported in the prior WIRE, RIOC Vice President of Operations Fernando Martinez discussed the potential rerouting at the previous RIRA meeting.  This is a complex problem and RIRA's Planning Committee (Matt Katz, Chair) and Island Services Committee (Aaron Hamburger, Chair) are investigating the problems and potential solutions.  More on this soon.2.  Transportation Problems with Tram Shutdown.  Matt Katz, RIRA's Planning Committee Chair, has sent a letter to the MTA complaining about their ignoring our problems.  I am following up with my own letter that addresses technical problems with the MTA's analysis.  We are considering everything from coordinating action with other communities along the F line to filing an Article 78 on the MTA.  We are concerned that once the tram shuts down, the congestion at the Roosevelt Island will be so severe that F trains will be delayed, which clogs the whole F line — not merely a delay for Roosevelt Island residents.  We are working with the elected officials (Lappin, Kellner, Serrano, Stringer, Maloney) to add pressure to the MTA to resolve these concerns.3.  The Next 10 Years?  The WIRE's editor Dick Lutz asks for our ideas.  Transportation infrastructure and adequate RIOC financing are the Island's main concerns.  Without transportation infrastructure, housing is less attractive; meanwhile RIOC's finances are overly dependent on new Southtown construction.  So using the creative technique &quot;instead trying to make it better, how do you make it worse?&quot;, I think leveling the Goldwater Hospital and building 5000 units of housing will really make things worse.  Or will it?  If we think about transforming Roosevelt Island to a transportation hub — a Hoboken of the East River — then we might be eligible to receive billions of transportation dollars to improve our transportation infrastructure because Roosevelt Island transportation would now provide a regional benefit, not merely a local benefit.  For example, the 53 Street and 60 Street lines could be hollowed out into subway stations and connected as a transfer point; ferry service would be much more attractive with higher numbers of passengers; and an underground moving walkway, for the length of the Island, would shuttle the new passengers (just like O'Hare airport).  In summary, to address our weaknesses (transportation, long-term RIOC finances), we market ourselves as a transportation hub (which betters our weaknesses).  OK, this isn't a 10-year plan, but a 20-40 year plan.4.  Robots for Kids 6-13 Years Old.  Last year, we had a great team of children who learned about and built robots (based upon Lego Mindstorms NXT), and they competed well in a City-wide competition.  With the help of the Roosevelt Island Youth Program and the PS/IS 217 Beacon Program, we are continuing again this year with a longer/larger program.  Brian Dorfmann and I are the mentors/coaches.  The cost is free.  We meet once a week 6:30 - 8PM at RIYP's second floor at 506 Main Street.  We might expand to two days a week.  Both boys and girls enjoy this, they enjoy socializing with children different than their own age, and it is a rewarding experience in many ways and at many levels.  Pizza is served for kids.5.  Adult Softball.  We are trying again this year to have a league.  I spoken with the Riverwalk Bar and Grill about having a kick-off meeting in February.  I'll have more details in my next column.6.  Upcoming RIRA meetings.  The next Common Council meetings are February 3 and March 3 at 8PM in the church lower floor.  Former RIRA President Steve Marcus is chairing the Public Purpose Grant committee, which is reviewing the seven applications received from RIOC.  The meetings are open to the public; come to the February 3 RIRA meeting to hear Steve's status report.  The next RIRA Town Hall meeting (for reviewing ...</body></row>

<body>Today the discussion of Rahm Emanuel's use of the word &quot;retard&quot; — to describe liberal Democrats who wanted to publicly attack fellow party members who oppose health-care reform — gets elevated even further:

I think the big news is the crackup going on. Our politically correct society is acting like some giant insult has taken place by calling a bunch of people who are retards, retards.  		
I mean, these liberal activists are kooks. They are loony tunes. And I'm not going to apologize for it, I'm just quoting Emanuel. It's in the news. I think the news is that he's out there calling Obama's number one supporters effing retards. So now there's going to be a meeting. There's going to be a retard summit at the White House, much like the beer summit between Obama and Gates and that cop in Cambridge.


Don't worry, Rush, we didn't expect you to apologize for using the word &quot;retard.&quot; Nor will we expect Sarah Palin to ask you to resign over it, either. But seriously, can we drop this word? Rush — Madonna uses it. Isn't that enough to make you never want to say it again? Though we will say it's generous of you to say that there's going to be a &quot;retard summit&quot; at the White House. We would have thought that in your world, there was one going on there all along.

 Responding to Palin-Emanuel controversy, Limbaugh says liberals who complained about health care reform &quot;are retards&quot; [Media Matters]

<body>Someday, thanks to Bloomberg's City Council, the flat-front security gates of New York will all be gone. As EV Grieve wrote, it's &quot;another step toward making NYC completely sanitized.&quot;The Times wrote of the gates, &quot;They have provided the clattering soundtrack of dawn and dusk, the steel canvas of struggling artists, the most compelling evidence that the city does, indeed, sleep.&quot; Many people would like to see the gates saved, maybe turned into art.One of those people is filmmaker Neil Goldberg.Back in 1996, Neil Goldberg put together a short video called &quot;Hallelujah Anyway No. 2.&quot; In the film, it is early morning on First Avenue in the East Village. Businesspeople are rolling up their metal gates. One after another, the gates clatter up into the eaves. They are rusty, noisy, and covered in graffiti. They are emblematic.Today, many of the businesses in the film have vanished.ReelNY interviewed Goldberg about the film in 1997. He said:&quot;I would notice when I pass someone opening their gates in the morning that I would have totally different reactions to it depending on how I was feeling that day. Like, 'Oh, how depressing, starting yet another day of selling, whatever, selling Drake's Cookies.' Or 'Yes, okay, we can do it,' you know, and feel ridiculous optimism.&quot;&quot;Also, I'm interested in dance... So, I love the particular gesture of lifting those gates, and the way that same movement passes over different bodies.&quot;The film will be shown tonight, Feb 2, at The Kitchen.Thanks to Mr. Goldberg for providing stills from his lovely film.</body></row>

<body>The forces of nature could not derail the latest edition of the Norwood News from hitting the streets and appearing online this week. Here's a little preview of what we have in store.We have a slightly tweaked version of the story we originally ran in this space on Monday about activist Desiree Pilgrim-Hunter's possible run for the senate seat occupied by Pedro Espada, Jr. (We hear Pilgrim-Hunter is holding a fundraiser tonight. These are the types of events that will determine if she's in it for the long haul.)A profile on the energetic new commanding officer of the 52nd Precinct. Plus an editorial on his prospects and how the NYPD can help communities police themselves. (Here's a hint: it's by providing them with more detailed information about where crime is happening in the neighborhoods they live in.)In other crime news, we have a story on the two 52nd Precinct cops who were suspended after a video surfaced of them beating a hand-cuffed suspect. Also, there's a brief about the precinct's first murder of 2010.? The COVE, a youth center in the Knox-Gates neighborhood, has reopened under new (old) leadership and a new focus. DeWitt Clinton High School just opened a brand new Business Center. Speaking of high schools, the Bronx Science boys basketball team compiled more wins this year than the last two combined and almost made the postseason. A team of doctors from Montefiore Medical Center, just back from Haiti, tell their story about participating in the massive post-earthquake relief effort. Plus: find free programs and services throughout the Bronx in our expanded Neighborhood Notes section (seriously, this page is packed with invaluable info) . . . find out what's going on arts and entertainment-wise in or Out and About section . . . and our Inquiring Photographer asks readers what they think about the looming city budget cuts.</body></row>

 Police are looking for the boyfriend of the Rev. Al Sharpton's daughter who allegedly slugged her and pushed her from a parked car yesterday, authorities said. 
  Dominique Sharpton, 23, and the 23-year-man were arguing about their relationship just before noon when he punched her in a mouth outside 220 W. 145th St., law-enforcement sources said. 
  She was treated at Harlem Hospital for a cut lip. The suspect, Latrelle Peeks of Harlem, fled.

 A Lower East Side thug abducted a masseuse, raped her, left her tied to a bedpost for hours and demanded a $100,000 ransom from her family, authorities said yesterday. 
  Wu Song Chen, 53, allegedly lured the 35-year- old woman to his apartment on Madison Street near Rutgers Street on Feb. 9. 
  He put a knife to her throat, threatened to kill her and raped her, police said. 
  He tied her with rope to the bedpost and ordered her to call her father, a Hong Kong businessman, and demand a wire transfer in the amount of $100,000, sources said. 
  Her father attempted to send the money but encountered difficulty and the wire transfer wasn't completed. 
  The victim managed to flee the next day and contact police, who arrested Chen on charges of rape and kidnapping.

 A knife-wielding thug robbed a stranger during a quickie sexual encounter in the victim's Hell's Kitchen apartment, police sources said yesterday. 
  The 34-year-old victim and the assailant, in his 30s, were engaged in sex in the apartment on West 43rd Street near Ninth Avenue at 7:15 p.m. Sunday, cops said. 
  Suddenly, the assailant pulled a knife and robbed the victim of a BlackBerry and $40. 
Queens

 A city correction officer was busted for driving around Corona with at least eight ounces of heroin, officials said yesterday. 
  Cops spotted Marco Villacris, 46, running a red light at Junction Boulevard and 41st Avenue at 3:40 p.m. Monday, authorities said. 
  When he was pulled over, the officer noticed an open plastic bag in the back seat of Villacris' Chevy Minivan and the strong odor of heroin. 
  Villacris, who joined the Correction Department in 2008, was charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance and two traffic infractions. A department spokesman said Villacris faces being fired. 
  Also arrested was Villacris' passenger, Johnny Gonzalez, 42, who allegedly presented a driver's license bearing a phony name. 
  Gonzalez also allegedly stashed seven additional fake IDs in the glove compartment. 
Brooklyn

  He's in more than a wee bit of trouble. 
  A vile passenger was busted for urinating in a taxi and stiffing the cabby on a $26 fare, authorities said yesterday. 
  The driver picked up Jonathan Pringle, 24, and Jahnece Riggins, 22, at West 50th Street and Ninth Avenue in Manhattan early Monday. 
  The passengers dozed off as the cabby drove them to their destination, Bedford and Gates avenues in Crown Heights, cops said. 
  The taxi arrived at the destination at 4:50 a.m., but when the driver woke up the snoozing duo, Pringle got belligerent and allegedly refused to pay the $26 fare, yelling, &quot;F--k you, we're not paying s--t!&quot; 
  He then urinated on the back seat as he mocked and threatened the driver, police said. 
  The hoodlums then pelted the taxi with chunks of ice as they fled and the driver called 911, sources said. 
  Police detectives soon chased down and busted the pair.

 She was quite incensed. 
  A Brownsville woman was arrested for attacking a neighbor who had complained about her constantly burning incense and smelling up the apartment building, authorities said yesterday.

<body>Read original...This wasn't WrestleMania 25, but a Queens teacher and aide are in hot water for orchestrating wrestling contest between students. Olive/GettyIt was the fourth-grade version of a steel-cage match - with teachers playing referee and children seeing their classmates bloodied.A Queens teacher and an aide orchestrated a sick wrestling contest between students in a locked classroom, prosecutors charged Monday.Joseph Gullotta and Abraham Fox were charged with child endangerment and yanked out of the classroom they allegedly transformed into a gladiator arena.The incident happened Thursday, after 10-year-old Tomas Rivera got into an argument with a classmate at Public School 65 in Ozone Park, officials said.Gullotta suggested that instead of taking out his anger on his nemesis, Tomas should wrestle another classmate, Justin Stokel, 9, authorities say. A girl in the class was told to shut the door, and students were told to stand at a safe distance as the mini-grapplers got ready to rumble.&quot;Everybody in my class was laughing,&quot; said Jonathan Michael, a fourth-grader. &quot;They were fighting over some pencils, and they were bleeding.&quot;During the wrestling match, Tomas' head struck Justin's mouth. Justin had a cut lip, and Tomas' head was swollen and badly bruised. Officials said Fox warned Gullotta that Justin might need stitches, but both men barred the boys from going to the nurse for almost two hours - then told them to lie about what had happened.School officials learned about the bizarre brawl when a parent of one of the combatants overheard him talking about it.Gullotta, 29, was sent to a teacher reassignment center - a so-called &quot;rubber room&quot; - and Fox, 43, was suspended without pay, said Education Department spokeswoman Margie Feinberg.Their lawyer declined to comment, and they declined to speak to a reporter at their homes on Long Island. The boys involved could not be reached.&quot;When parents send their children off to school, their teachers have an obligation to provide a safe environment for them,&quot; said Queens District Attorney Richard Brown.tzambito@nydailynews.com With Michael J.

<body>Shhhh, are the kids out the room? If not don't scroll down just yet! This post may contain material not suitable for children 17 and under. They're gone? Good, now we can talk. Okay last Sunday I began my first night hosting VIP at &quot;Pink Ellie&quot; (aka Pink Elephant/nka Pink) hold the applause for later. I've DONE Sundays before starting w/ NV (y'all remember NV right?) then a lil' spot called Sliver, then on to Vue (now Nikki Beach). From there on to Spotlight Live (formally Noche), ending up at the monster of Sunday nights &quot;Magic City&quot; @ LQ! You get the point...I'VE DONE SUNDAY NIGHTS folks! But this HERE, this one here felt different! Strolled in early w/ Block members DJ Trauma (Soundproof/Alador &amp; Smith) &amp; L.A. (the Stylistics Agency) to shake off the rust and introduce myself to staff. So folks can get familiar with the face they cutting checks to (LOL). Round 12:30-1:00am ish I was type nervous cause it was tea party light size attendance in there. (Producer) Rich Younglord, Chadon (stylist), Toni Renee' (stylist), the ladies of Detailed Events showed up, so we all grabbed a table to get a first row seat to &quot;the movie&quot; about to happen. By like 1:30-2am it was ZOOLOGY in there! Tigers, bears, gorilla pimps OH MY! I keep looking around for the director to say &quot;CUT!&quot; You'd sware  Lil' Wayne or Young Jeezy was filming a video that night!  For a non-holiday Sunday night, it got 'nanas man. I know the waitresses were exhausted from the constant stream of bottles dudes KEEP ordering. No lie, true story, dudes were competing trying to &quot;out pop&quot; each other! To the point that one table bought a bottle for even the damn BATHROOM attendant! You heard me right, THE BATHROOM attendant dawg! Then the other &quot;street ballers&quot; bought bottles for the COAT CHECK girls and EVERY other table...Magnum size bottles mind you! Game OVER! I s@#t you not, almost EVERY table in a two foot radius had a bottle resting on top by 3am. GOD DAMN is right! Oh what a night! Silky Valente (Soundproof /Block Association) showed face, that's when the &quot;movie&quot; turned widescreen 3D , no bootleg.  Liquor look like it was pouring right in yo face...cause it probably WAS! How anybody got out alive (or sober) is beyond me. Happy B'day to the ladies that came out to support my first night (Mimi &amp; Latoya)! Hope it lived up to what you wanted &amp; more!  I'll post video later but for now peep game. See you next Sunday after &quot;My Uber Sunday&quot; Super Bowl party. Pink WILL be the after after party.</body></row>

<body>By Cayte Grieve		  	February 19, 2010 
	  				 	 			 				Last night the &quot;fashion set&quot; bid the tents at Bryant Park adieu and turned the runways into 1Oak- a look that came complete with dancing models, Moet and Ronnie Madra. I put &quot;fashion set&quot; in those very convenient quotations because partiers were more of the &quot;drinking set,&quot; as apparently none of the people who had spent the most time under the big top- the fashion editors, designers and front row stars- could muster the nostalgia necessary to say goodbye. That and Calvin Klein was having his party somewhere else.
	 	  (’’)In any case, a big stink has been made about what will happen to NYFW when it moves to Lincoln Center in the fall, farther away from the Garment District and all of those downtown fashionistas. Will more designers choose to show off site? Will downtown-dwelling stars and fashion mags decline to travel all the way to the Dakotas? Will New York as a fashion capital lose its international cred from the lack of a centralized location if said designers continue to show independently? Will the Lincoln Center give fashion credibility as an art form? Deep stuff, right? 


These are all really important questions that I’ll leave to be answered by the Sunday Styles (or teen bloggers writing from Arkansas who seem to have just as much validity). I’m more interested in figuring out how the “fashion set” will defile transform the UWS nabe into fashion land, what tequila hole Michael Kors will turn to for a pre-show blackout, what hotel the cast of Jersey Shore will take over, what unassuming quaint pub Kate Moss will put on the map, if they do so choose to journey north.


Hot spot for over-worked fashion editors to cry it out after getting snubbed by the Wintour.

Old: Ruby Tuesday. Distance: Just over a block from Bryant Park, on 7th Avenue.

Why: The food chain provides many carb options, something the editor has been abstaining from for half their life, and an atmosphere one can be sure is totally free from fashion peers. Let the floodgates open- Fashion Week is tough, but easier with cheese, breaded and fried.

New: Central Park. Distance: One block east of the Lincoln Center. 

Why:  What better place to run to in a fit of rage and “why me?” than freaking Central Park? The editor will feel as if they’re starring in a weepy Woody Allen film; scorned woman turning away from all she knows to find answers in the woods of Manhattan! The drama! Bonus as an ego boost when they find smirking at tourists in flip-flops easy from their perch on Prada pumps. 


Hot spot for models to gorge between shows.

Old: Crumbs 42nd Street. Distance: In Bryant Park.

Why: If you’re making up for a week’s worth of calories, you should at least be eating something pretty and within walking distance from your next call time. 

New: Magnolia Columbus. Distance: 4 blocks north of Lincoln Center.

Why:  The fact that they are Carrie cupcakes (for models still infatuated with SATC) makes the walk to gorge worth it. Besides, models never make call times.


Spot for designers to have a pre-show stiff one. 

Old: Cellar Bar @ the Bryant Park Hotel. Distance: Pretty much on top of Bryant Park.

Why: Cellar Bar is a sophisticated rager, perfect for sophisticates in need of numbing nerves and their publicist’s front row choices.

New: Candle Bar. Distance: Roughly 8 blocks north, or one subway stop from the Lincoln Center.

Why: Gay dive that’s a nice counterbalance to the frat-tastic bullshit of the Upper West Side. And we all know how progressive the fashion world is. 


Cheesy fashion-themed bar big with tourists.

Old: Stitch Bar and Lounge Distance: 3 blocks south, 2 block west of the Bryant Park tents.

Why: They have cocktails named Anna Wintour, Silk Scarf and Stiletto. This place screams “Girl’s Weekend!”

New: None, yet. Maybe Rosa Mexicano will change her name to Rosa Cha of the occasion?

Why:  While there are quite a few Jazz or Opera themed bars, the UWS is prime for fashion to make its mark. Right locals? Anna Win-tini  could be on the menu at any given...</body></row>

<body>NEW YORK — What began as a tepid courtship between fashion and social media has become an all-consuming love affair as designers unveil new digital initiatives for fashion week.Calvin Klein, Marc Jacobs, Michael Kors, Tommy Hilfiger, Rodarte and Perry Ellis are among the brands that will live stream their shows over the coming week, while scores of others — including Oscar de la Renta, Tory Burch and Nanette Lepore — are using Facebook, Twitter and their Web sites to update fashion followers on their shows, effectively expanding access beyond the exclusive enclaves of Bryant Park.“Ignoring the Internet is total madness,” said Diane von Furstenberg, who didn’t live stream her show Sunday but did update her Facebook page with backstage photos and tweeted from the event. “Being active on the Internet is indispensable to growth and for being relevant. It helps your business to be truly global and truly multigenerational.”More brands than ever are embracing live streaming this season for two reasons, said James Gardner, founder and chief executive officer of CreateThe Group, a social-media focused agency. “First of all, the cost of streaming and bandwidth has come down significantly. And consumers’ appetite seems unquenchable for fashion.”Michael Kors has proof of just that. The brand began live streaming its show two years ago and saw a 111 percent increase in page views from the spring 2009 live stream to the fall 2009 one. There was another 81 percent jump from the fall 2009 show to the spring 2010 event.Brands are adding a few new wrinkles this time round, however. Calvin Klein, in its first foray into live streaming, broadcast its men’s show Sunday and will do the same with its women’s show Thursday. The live streams are being shown on the company’s Web site as well as on the brand’s Facebook page. The company is using Facebook to allow feedback from viewers.Alexander Wang collaborated with SHOWstudio’s Nick Knight for live feeds of his show. According to Wang, it became apparent last season that live feeds were what all the “megabrands” were doing. He continued, “We like to push the boundaries…and we wanted it to be much more democratic, and we wanted to do something special that no one’s ever done before.” The designer took the idea of a Web site live stream and upped the ante, by broadcasting his show Saturday on a Times Square billboard. With the live feed in Times Square, Wang achieved his goal, that “everyone [be able to] at least access [the collection] and view it and experience it.”Proenza Schouler designers Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez aren’t simply live streaming their show Wednesday night — they’re using it as a selling tool. For 24 hours after the show at Milk Studios, online shoppers can preorder the fall handbags straight from the runway through the recently introduced e-commerce on the site.“Having a voice and personality on the Internet has become increasingly important,” Shirley Cook, chief executive officer of Proenza Schouler, said. “It’s a place for people to connect to what Jack and Lazaro have to say. Live broadcasting on our Web site is the closest thing to being a guest at our show. You’re seeing everything as it is intended to be seen.”Isaac Mizrahi is displaying a countdown to his show Thursday on his video blog. “Fashion in a way is even more about communication than it is about clothes,” said Mizrahi. “I feel communication has always been more important than [strictly] fashion.…It’s just one more way for me to communicate to my audience.” Mizrahi said he decided on a live feed because, “It’s more exposure. I don’t know if every woman wants to come to the fashion show, but they certainly want a peek at it.”After years of avoiding social media, the Marc Jacobs brand will dive in headfirst this season via Twitter and a live feed at 8 p.m. tonight on its Web site. President Robert Duffy began tweeting in late January and has filled his Twitter feed with a flurry of daily updates on everything from “the most inspiring person,” in his life to ticket giveaways and behind-the-scenes pictur...</body></row>

<body>FRIDAY, FEB. 19

* MUSICAL CHAIRS

Through the luck of an empty seat, we found ourselves seated in the front row next to Russell Simmons at the Isaac Mizrahi show yesterday. Between his frequent tweets about both biblical scripture and runway fashion, Simmons told us about Flaviana Matata, a former Miss Tanzania whom he and SI swimsuit star Julie Henderson recently helped land a modeling contract. On the other side of Buzz was Veronica Webb, the first African-American model with a national cosmetics deal, in 1994. Webb is also hopeful for more international diversity. “There’s still a long way to go,” she said, “but if there’s anything this industry loves, it’s an emerging market.”
* TIMBERLAKE TOURISM

“Memphis,” the Broadway musical, is a hit with Southern tourists, and Justin Timberlake’s parents are no exception. The night before his William Rast show, Paul and Lynn Harless, visiting from Memphis, the actual city, took a chauffeured car from their hotel to the Shubert Theatre. Lynn told us they loved the show, and the best part: Their driver’s name was Elvis.
* RIPPED, TORN

Fresh from an appearance on David Letterman, “SNL” starlet Abby Elliott took a moment out from partying on Hudson Terrace’s VIP deck to give Buzz her take on Fashion Week. “Ripped is the new torn! Get it? Rip Torn!” Really, Abby, there’s nothing funny about alcoholism . . . OK, maybe there is.
* HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL

“Queer Eye for the Straight Guy” star Carson Kressley was chillin’ backstage in the W Lounge when we asked if there was room for a “Straight Eye for the Queer Guy” program on TV. “Sure, it’s called high school,” quipped Kressley, adding, “I love The Post.”
* THAT'S ALL, FOLKS!

Eighteen years of Bryant Park shows came to a close with Tommy Hilfiger making an emotional speech at the end of his show, the last in the park. Ashley Olsen, Rosario Dawson, Ed Westwick and a contingent of NY Giants came out to see this fashion finale. In a season conspicuously low on A-list star power, Rosario offered us some perspective: “There was an era when designers made their clothes for the famous. But that was the time of Marilyn Monroe,” she said. “Now the designers are celebrities themselves, and our presence is not so important.”
* HAUTE APPLIANCE 

Vivienne Tam is a creative force who wants to be known for more than only designing clothes. She already has a line of couture notebook computers, and yesterday announced a new series of $200 headphones that are as much fashion accessory as consumer electronics. Buzz asked her what's next on the design radar. &quot;A cell phone might be interesting, but what I’d really like to try is a fashionable rice cooker.&quot;
* EAST VILLAGE DREAMS 

Playing fancy Fashion Week parties in the city’s swankiest lounges might be a DJs dream, but for Misshapes Leigh Lezark and Geordon Nicol, all that glitters is not gold. &quot;We’d prefer to play at Lit,&quot; Lezark told Buzz from behind the DJ booth at the Boom Boom Room, referring to the dank East Village dive bar. &quot;It’s where we learned our style.&quot; 
* FASHION FREEZE 

Party people at the Jeremy Scott afterparty at Good Units had an unusual Fashion Week treat. In addition to the open Belvedere vodka bar, a Ben &amp; Jerry's cart slung Cheery Garcia and other flavors to the overheated revelers. Supervising the operation was none other than Ben &amp; Jerry’s CEO Walt Freeze. That’s right. The CEO of Ben &amp; Jerry’s is named Walt Freeze. Buzz can’t make this stuff up! 
THURSDAY, FEB. 18

* JT’S MOM GIVES THUMBS UP 

Swiping aside rumors of a split, Jessica Biel was smiling and playing the dutiful girlfriend at Justin Timberlake’s show last night. When Buzz asked her about JT’s knack for putting his own daily outfit together, Biel declared with sass, “My man don’t do nothing wrong!”
As for her own role in the new collection, she couldn’t say whether she provided any inspiration. Muse or not, JT’s parents love Biel, and chatted happily with her before the show. “She is so down to earth and real,” beamed Lynn Harless, JT’s mom, in with JT’s dad from Memphis.
Mom agreed that her son can do no ...</body></row>

David Bizer, a former Lehman Brothers exec who now heads up sales at Nomura Securities in London, has relisted his 24th-floor apartment at 15 Central Park West. The two-bedroom pad, which Bizer bought for $5.3 million in December 2007 and put back on the market for $8.975 just five months later, had been listed for $7.25 million when it was taken off the market last year. Now it's back on the market for $7.495 million. [Cityfile, Corcoran]</body></row>

<body>Revolving Door Image From CREWAn update to this post linking to a NY Observer article regarding the resignation of NY State DHCR Commissioner and RIOC Board Chairperson Deborah VanAmerongen. According to the article, Ms. VanAmerongen is resigning as DHCR Commissioner  to take a position with the Affordable Housing Group of the Nixon Peabody Law Firm. ... Ms. VanAmerongen is jumping to the private sector ship, joining a firm that has an active affordable housing group and one that does significant work with Ms. VanAmerongen's agency, the Division of Housing and Community Renewal, including deals this year.... A spokeswoman for the DHCR said Ms. VanAmerongen recused herself from decisions with the potential for conflict of interest.Steve Wallace, a partner who heads Nixon Peabody's affordable housing group, said Ms. VanAmerongen, who is not an attorney, will be a &quot;strategic policy adviser,&quot; offering guidance on affordable housing issues in New York and nationally. The firm represents developers and lenders, among others in the affordable housing industry...Several readers of the post were critical of Ms. VanAmerongen and expressed concern over potential conflicts between her former position at DHCR and new private sector job including this: VanAmerongen should disclose her business dealings with Nixon Peabody as commissioner. How well has this firm done during her tenure?However, another reader supported Ms VanAmerongen: You guys have all the answers, but don't know squat. At least Ms. VanAmerongen made her meetings with the RIOC Board of Directors. Her predecesor and the person who comes next .... No Shows. You'll see. All of you want to throw stones and nit-pick.I worked with her and she has integrity. Good for her that she's moved on to a higher paying job. Public Service is a thankless job. If any of you could do it, you'd all jump to make more money for you &amp; your families too.I inquired of RIOC President Steve Shane: As you know, DHCR Commissioner/ RIOC Board Chairperson VanAmerongen resigned these positions to join the Affordable Housing Practice Group at the Nixon Peabody Law Firm.Does Nixon Peabody represent RIOC currently, previously, or are they bidding for future work?Also, are they (Nixon Peabody) representing any other parties involved in past, current or future Roosevelt Island issues including but not limited to the potential privatizations of Island House, Rivercross and Westview.Thank you.Mr. Shane replied: Nixon Peabody does no work for RIOC, is not bidding on any and any suggested relationship to the Commissioner's new relationship post State employment is entirely without foundation.Later that day Mr. Shane elaborated:In reviewing my e mail to you as to Nixon Peabody, the information therein is absolutely correct.However, notwithstanding that they have not done any work for RIOC nor are they bidding on any, they are, as a large, well established law firm with a long and well deserved reputation for expertise in the area, inter alia, of affordable housing. In response to prior solicitations, Nixon Peabody is on the pre-approved panel of law firms who could be considered for employment by RIOC for matters as they might arise.RIOC maintains such panels of architects, engineers, lawyers,  plumbers, electricians, etc. with appropriate sub-panels) to respond to immediate needs without having to go through a more lengthy process in formal public bidding. We do then have a less formal bidding process among the panel members, having already familiarized ourselves with the individual qualifications of the panel members to meet the needs of the individual situation. Every so often, we refresh the panels by putting out an RFQ and  bringing a recommendation to the Board for a reconstituted panel.I replied:Thank you for the additional infomation.It appears that Nixon Peabody was involved in representing the Tenant organization at Island House during privatization efforts in 2005. I don't know if NP is still involved in this process.Also, my inquiry was not meant to imply any impropriety, just fact checking.The NY...</body></row>

<body>Main Street Image Of Roosevelt Island Is The Village From GlarkA reader of this post on the good bread sold at the Roosevelt Island Farmers Market commented:BTW, I liked the bread and think we should have a bakery here.  maybe sometime soon.and another asked:I thought getting new stores here was now in the laps of the RIOC Board Members.... Can someone ask them what's being done to fill the storefronts?We may be getting some answers soon regarding the deploring condition of Roosevelt Island's Main Street retail situation. Later today, the Roosevelt Island Board of Directors Real Estate Development committee will be meeting and one of the items on the Agenda is an update on the Main Street Master Leaseholder status.. PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that a meeting of the Real Estate Development Advisory Committee of the RIOC Board of Directors will be held on Monday, February 8, 2010 at 6:00 p.m. at the RIOC administrative office, 591 Main Street, Roosevelt Island, New York. The Committee will meet to:discuss ground lease extensions for the Mitchell-Lama projects in the context of privatization plans; andreceive an update on the Main Street master lease RFP initiative.During the December 2009 RIOC Board Meeting, the Real Estate Development Committee reported (From the Minutes of RIOC's December Meeting Page 9):REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT ADVISORY COMMITTEE ...Mr. Kalkin noted that the Committee met on November 20, 2009 to discuss the draft of the appraisal of the Main Street commercial spaces that was prepared by Liberty Appraisal Services.  Mr. Kalkin stated that the Committee agreed to go ahead with an RFP for the retail master lease, and today the Board voted to hire Jones Lang to provide necessary consulting services and draft the RFP.  Mr. Kalkin also noted that the Committee decided not to extend the hardware store lease, but rather to offer the current tenant a month-to-month tenancy, so as to allow it to pay its arrears and continue operating the business until an alternative arrangement is set in place....More Roosevelt Island Main Street retail real estate news from the minutes of December 2009 board meeting (page 10):  ... Mr. Shane noted that the hardware store’s lease had expired as of November 30, 2009.  Per the Real Estate Development Advisory Committee’s directive, RIOC will seek to offer the tenant Liberty of Roosevelt Island Corp. a month-to-month tenancy with a requirement to vacate the premises upon the expiration of a 30-day period after appropriate notice is given by RIOC.  For the time being, the tenant will pay $3,400 per month, along with the additional $100 per month as amortization of its arrears until the entire sum of $2,400 is paid...Here's some additional information on Main Street Master Leaseholder concept and the Roosevelt Island Main Street Retail Study.On the Ground Lease extension for Roosevelt Island's Mitchell Lama Buildings, the December 2009 minutes also reveal (Page 4)...The second item of new business was the authorization to enter into an amendment of the real estate consulting services contract with Jones Lang LaSalle Americas, Inc.Mr. Shane reminded the Board that RIOC has an agreement with Jones Lang LaSalle Americas, Inc. (“Jones Lang”) with respect to real estate consulting on Roosevelt Island.  He provided a brief history of Jones Lang’s consulting services for the Corporation.  Mr. Shane mentioned that according to the agreement, Jones Lang’s compensation was comprised of a monthly stipend and commission.  He then noted that the Jones Lang agreement has been tolled for the last two-and-a-half years.Mr. Shane stated that the Island House, Rivercross and Westview projects are currently seeking to extend their ground leases and withdraw from the State’s Mitchell-Lama program.  Mr. Shane further noted that DHCR worked out a formula for building conversion, which meets DHCR standards for long-term affordability.  However, according to Mr. Shane, given the complexity of the Mitchell-Lama withdrawal process and the diverse scenarios that may ensue,  RIOC would need a consultant to provide econ...</body></row>

<body>Adrianne Pasquarelli - On Wednesday afternoon more than 250 marched from SoHo to Union Square to demonstrate against alleged unfair wage practices at two New York retailers. The event was organized by the Retail Action Project, which works with retail workers in lower Manhattan to make sure fair wage practices are followed. The Retail Action Project is part of the Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union. Beginning at 4 p.m., participants walked from Amsterdam Boutique, a Mystique Boutique affiliate, at 454 Broadway on the corner of Grand Street, to Shoe Mania at 654 Broadway on the corner of Bond Street. They then headed north to the Shoe Mania location at Union Square.“People understand now that we need good jobs in New York City,” said Stuart Appelbaum, president of the retail union. “The only way people are going to get through this economic crisis is if we produce good jobs paying living wages.”About 150 current and former Shoe Mania employees say they were denied overtime payment and are owed $3 million in damages for violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act. The group filed a collective action lawsuit last year with the state attorney general's office and has been in settlement negotiations since the fall. Mystique, a fast fashion chain with several New York City affiliates, is also being investigated for labor violations. Workers say the chain owes between $1.7 million and $2 million for unpaid overtime and minimum wage. Employees were allegedly paid $5.25 an hour, which is $2 below minimum wage, for 66-hour work weeks.“[Shoe Mania] stole money from us,” said Ahmed Dalhatu, who worked at Shoe Mania for three years before the West 34th Street store closed prior to Christmas last year. “They were using us because we didn't know any better. There were a lot of immigrants who didn't know about the law.” Mr. Dalhatu, who is attending the march, said he did not receive overtime pay and was required to work 60-hour weeks. He had been trying to save enough funds to pay for business school and has since found a new job.Representatives from Mystique Boutique and Shoe Mania did not immediately return calls requesting comment.</body></row>

<body>Even more romantic: A White Castle Snuggie. 		Yesterday when we discovered that resy scalpers run rampant on Valentine’s Day, we assumed they were targeting places like Daniel and Blue Hill. But check out this Craigslist ad: “Problem finding that special someone something nice? SOLUTION=take her to a fine dining expericence [sic] that you will both remember!” That being the White Castle at Eighth Avenue and 36th Street. At 5:15 p.m. Sad part is, we’re kind of tempted. 

ONCE IN A LIFETIME, UNFORGETABLE - $1 [Craigslist]

<body>Clearly vying for a polished image of its beloved Americana denim and such, Levi's has announced it will open a shop in the Meatpacking District this fall -- putting it right up against fashion A-listers like Alexander McQueen and Stella McCartney.The Meatpacking District went from a region on the fringes of the city serving its one eponymous purpose, to a gritty-cool haven for designers to prove their cutting edge, attracting the likes of Diane von Furstenberg, Matthew Williamson, Theory, Vince, Jeffrey and eventually, Apple.  Levi's, which extends itself from limited-edition vintage going for upwards of $500, Capital E in the $100-$200 range, the mainstream stuff up to $80 and its lowest level Signature line offered at big box mass retailers like Wal-mart and Target. It's unclear what the Meatpacking shop will focus on within that range, but we concur with neighbor Jeffrey, whose president Jeffrey Kalinsky clarified Levis' status as its own genre, rather than a notch somewhere along the price-point scale.  We're talking 501s, not Wet Seal, after all.  Dare we say it? Meatpacking isn't really the pinnacle of hip anymore, so a little Levi's can't hurt - it may even shift the neighborhood's cache to different heights.</body></row>

<body>Cutting-edge fashion designer Alexander McQueen -- devastated by the recent death of his mother -- hanged himself in his London home yesterday, sending a bolt of sadness through the heart of the fashion world. He was just 40. 
  Word of his death cast a deep pall over the opening of New York's Fashion Week, where McQueen's colleagues received the shocking news right at the beginning of the first major show beneath the tent at Bryant Park. 
  Immediately after the last model walked off the runway, Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour quickly walked out as devastated fashionistas sat in stunned silence. 
  &quot;It's a tragedy beyond anything. I don't know how to understand it,&quot; said Fern Mallis, VP of the IMG agency and the organizer of Fashion Week. Fashion editor Annabel Tollman put her hand to her mouth when told the news. 
  &quot;Oh, my God. Shocking. It's a really sad loss for the fashion industry, for the world,&quot; she said. 
  McQueen was one of the most innovative and successful young designers in the fashion world. His dramatic and edgy creations fit in equally well on the red carpet or a grungy rock club. But his personal life was in turmoil as he dealt with the death of his mother, Joyce, on Feb. 2. He was supposed to attend her funeral today. 
  &quot;His mother died and he couldn't cope,&quot; one source told Britain's Daily Mail. &quot;His Paris show is coming up and his staff have been nagging him all week to get up and start working. But . . . he just couldn't get up.&quot; 
  The paper quoted sources as saying that McQueen, who had been in bed for a week, had cuts on his arms and that he'd attempted suicide more than once. 
  During an interview conducted by his mother in 2004, McQueen told her his greatest fear was &quot;dying before you.&quot; 
  Aside from the loss of his mom, the suicide of style icon and close pal Isabella Blow three years ago and last year's death of his aunt Dolly, a fixture at his shows, weighed heavily on him. 
  The designer was also reportedly facing pressure to complete his autumn/winter women's wear collection for its launch in Paris next month, and was distraught over the end of a recent relationship, according to The Times of London. McQueen had a civil partnership with filmmaker George Forsyth in 2000 that ended three years ago, and he took up with a porn star known as Mr. Stag, the paper reported. 
  Wintour called him &quot;one of the greatest talents of his generation,&quot; and said his &quot;passing marks an insurmountable loss.&quot; 
  The son of a British cabdriver, Lee Alexander McQueen caught the fashion scene's attention in London in the 1990s. He quickly won over audiences in Paris, New York and Milan, and rose to the top tier of the design world. 
  Despite the unbridled adulation, McQueen was a mostly private man, rarely granting interviews and staying out of the limelight. But after his mom's death, he posted several grim comments on Twitter about his anguish. 
  &quot;Been a f- - -ing awful week but my friends have been great but now I have to some how pull myself together,&quot; he wrote on Sunday. 
  In a posting the day after his mother died, he insisted, &quot;Life must go on.&quot; 
  Police were called to his multimillion-dollar London apartment early yesterday after his body was found, The Sun reported. A blond man who told reporters he was McQueen's boyfriend later came out, weeping. 
  McQueen's designs often pushed the envelope, and his dramatic pieces and impeccable tailoring were beloved by luminaries such as Madonna, Lady Gaga, Naomi Campbell and Michelle Obama. 
  He was also responsible for the design of the infamous cat suit worn by Janet Jackson during her breast-baring &quot;wardrobe malfunction&quot; at the 2004 Super Bowl. 
  In 2003, Queen Elizabeth II made McQueen a commander of the British empire. 
  &quot;All of his shows were memorable because he was such a risk taker,&quot; said Barneys' creative director Simon Doonan. &quot;His show always involved things that were extraordinary.&quot; 
  At his spring-summer 2010 collection show in Paris, he featured sculptural cocktail dresses in psychedelic snakeskin prints, and impossible-looking, hum...</body></row>

<body>Throughout New York Fashion Week, one of our favorite Brit chanteuses, Little Boots,
aka Victoria Hesketh, will be blogging about her Fashion Week exploits,
leading up to the March 2nd U.S. release of her full-length debut, Hands. She plays the Highline Ballroom on March 2nd and 3rd. The weekend seems to have gone so quickly! Saturday found us all nursing the most harrowing of hangovers but we managed to drag ourselves to the Alexander Wang show. The first word that sprung to my mind was &quot;epic,&quot; as the show was set in a huge hanger with more lights than I thought were possible. There were people everywhere, and it felt like forever before they actually managed to clear the runway and start the show.If I'm being totally honest, my initial reaction to the show was a little confused, as pinstriped tailoring met lace, velvet and chunky knits with huge oversize sleeves and bare midriffs. I loved the feel of the show with the moody music and make up, and by the last few dresses (I? particularly had my eye on a red velvet and lace number with a definite nod to the '90s) all had become clear. Apparently Wang said the show was inspired by &quot;women who make money and women who steal money,&quot; and the show definitely felt like a statement.We missed out on parties that night and opted for a lovely dinner and some chilled drinks in Brooklyn which was a nice change from the bustle of the fashion pack and a good way to clear my head for studio the next day. Before I got started I managed to squeeze into the DKNY show, where I sat with model Poppy Delevigne and Mad Men actress Alison Brie who were both lovely. DKNY loaned me a great spangly jacket for the morning, which was a motif that came up throughout the show, mixed in geometric patterned dresses and trailing scarves. I loved the camel and burgundy coats, which looked so wearable and effortlessly stylish.?</body></row>

<body>Note: More media content is available for this story at BrooklynPaper.com.By Gersh KuntzmanThe Brooklyn PaperFinally, we have a new poet laureate!

After a grueling seven-month search prompted by the June death of balladry legend Ken Siegelman, Borough President Markowitz revealed in his “State of the Borough” address last night the identity of our new versifier in chief.

It’s Tina Chang of Park Slope.

Yes, that Tina Chang.

Chang will become the fourth poet to assume the illustrious post, which comes with no pay, but the admiration of a rhyme-hungry borough accustomed to the best in poetry.

In winning the coveted post, Chang beat out 21 other applicants.

“I am thrilled,” Markowitz said of Chang. “She will truly embrace the role of Brooklyn’s poetic ambassador. She has dedicated her life to poetry and is passionate about reaching and educating diverse communities.”

In a statement, Chang spoke of creating an “Adopt-a-Poet” Day in local middle schools and hosting various workshops. She also wants to use the Internet to connect Brooklyn poets to the community.

“I see myself as an ambassador and activist on behalf of poetry,” said Chang, a Hunter College and Sarah Lawrence teacher who is the author of “Half-Lit Houses” and the editor of “Language for a New Century: Contemporary Poetry from the Middle East, Asia and Beyond.

“Over the past decade, I’ve given myself over to poetry completely, engaging students, teachers, writers, librarians, the young, the aging, as well as many people of diverse cultural and social economic backgrounds.”

So how good is this new Bard of Brooklyn? Well, Chang beat out The Brooklyn Paper’s reader’s choice, Sharon Mesmer, and is the co-founder of an annual collaborative reading series between the Asian-American Writers’ Workshop and Cave Canem that brings together Asian- and African-American writers.

And she read her poem, “Praise,” at the event on Wednesday to generally favorable reviews.

Judge for yourself:

“Praise” by Tina Chang

All night long there was digging, and the bodies like accordionsBent into their own dying instruments, and even after this,After the quake, there was, in news reports, still singing:A woman’s clapping was followed by another who shuffledAnd dragged her own apparition through the ruined streets,Though each one knew the anthem the other was singing.History taught them better. No one was coming.The film crews had their sights on the large hotels,The embassies. So they set to digging with their handsAnd with the shoes of those who were no longer alive.And with that, night fell and fell againLike an old black pot tumbling to the ground.When a man dies, the first thing that goes is his breath,And the last thing that goes is his memory.I once saw this civilization passing through a great white door,People weeping, then the weeping was followed by the soundOf tambourines rattling the heavy air, something that soundedLike celebration only livelier and more holy, voices rising,And then a marching into the dusty road of the next century.When shelter is gone, find your solace on the ground.And when the ground is gone, lift yourself and walk.And after all the great monuments of your memoryHave collapsed, with the sky steady above you,You shatter that too, with song.Comment on this story.</body></row>

      February 24, 2010. Steady rain falling yesterday into the night in New York.
        
First things first. Last night at the Café Carlyle, Lord Charles Spencer-Churchill invited me to the opening of John Standing performing Noel Coward. I am a Noel Coward aficionado although with the exception of the late Bobby Short who had his own musical signature, I’ve never really been impressed by those who’ve followed in Coward's tracks singing his songs that always sounded not quite the “right” Noel without him. 

Until last night. Better even maybe than Noel Coward, is this Noel.  There were many people in the room who already knew that about him, including some who’ve been following Standing for years – including Sarah, Duchess of York who came out of the dark and took the stage right after the lights cameup, urging everyone to come back again and again to hear this very funny man with his “sly biological urge” sing the highly witty, funny Coward songs.
    
  
  
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
  
  
    
      
          
            
          
      
      
      
          
            
          
      
    
  
  
    
      Blanding in performance last night at the
      Cafe Carlyle.
      John Blanding after his Noel Coward performance with an old friend, agent Boatie Boatwright.
    
  
  
    
      
    
  
  
    
      After performance, Sarah, Duchess of York takes the stage with her friend Mr. Standing.
    
  
  
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
  
  
    
      Born Sir John Ronald Leon, Standing’s mother, the actress Kay Hammond, performed in original Coward productions on the West End. Although he doesn’t use the title, he succeeded his father as 4th baronet. He was born at Bletchley, the family country house in Buckinghamshire which served as the Enigma code breaking center during World War II.
        
On his mother’s side he was born into a distinguished acting dynasty.  Educated at Eton, he served in the King’s Royal Rifle Corps, and has worked extensively on both London and New York stages as well as films including “King Rat,” “The Psychopath,” “The Eagle Has Landed,” “Elephant Man,” “Mrs. Dalloway,” etc., as well as television in the BBC’s 12 part “The First Churchills,” and “Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy.”

Standing recounted last night that he first met Noel Coward at age 10 when the boy went backstage to see his mother who was appearing in a Coward show, and Coward was having tea in her dressing room after the show.
    
  
  
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
  
  
    
      
    
  
  
    
      Lord Charles, a friend, John and Sarah Standing and the duchess after the show.
    
  
  
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
  
  
    
      “His head shone, his dressing gown shone, his shoes shone. Everything about Noel Coward was shining,” he recalled his childhood memory.
        
Until last night I didn’t think it possible to revive Noel Coward’s songs for us later generations, as performers seem to “act” Noel Coward-ish when performing his material. John Standing, however, lends his own style to the Master’s work. Dressed in an open shirt, well-worn blue blazer, grey jeans, you’re all ready for the come-what-may of a man who can tell a good joke (as if surrounded by friends at the bar). And he just sings ‘em, lousy voice and all, like a witty, carefree upper class Brit that he is, who gets every word of the Coward lyrics, and delivers ‘em to you (like a pro) for a night of laughter and music. Brilliant beyond. 

If you’re a Noel Coward fan/aficionado, and you’ve never heard John Standing, don’t miss this one.

<body>Miriam Kreinin Souccar - The Brooklyn Community Foundation and United Way of New York City are launching a fund Thursday to aid New York City's Haitian population in the wake of the earthquake in their native country. Called the New York City Haitian Community Hope and Healing Fund, the money will go to local nonprofit organizations that can help people deal with everything from legal services related to immigration, case management for the economic and housing impacts as families re-unite, the educational needs of new immigrants and services for coping with grief. The Brooklyn Foundation and United Way have each committed $100,000 to start the fund. So far, the Altman Foundation has committed $75,000 and Capital One Bank and St. Francis College have given unspecified amounts. The fund will be seeking additional donations, including those from the general public.“While attention to date has focused mostly on immediate and short-term needs in Haiti, NYC's Haitian community will face significant, long-term challenges as a result of this tragedy,” said Gordon Campbell, chief executive of United Way of New York City. “They will include psychological and emotional impacts such as trauma and grief, as well as tangible consequences, such as loss of income, orphaned children and many other issues that will put members of this vibrant community of all ages at risk.” New York City is home to one of the largest Haitian populations outside of Port-au-Prince, with more than 140,000 people, most of who live in Brooklyn and Queens. According to Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz, a staggering 59% of Haitian Americans in the United States have lost a loved one in the tragedy. “The fund will help address the short-and long-term needs of our Haitian American communities in Brooklyn and Queens,” Mr. Markowitz said. The fund's co-chairs are Carine Jocelyn, executive director of Diaspora Community Services, and William Pollard, president of Medgar Evers College. An advisory committee comprised of leaders within the local Haitian community and experts in the long-term effects of disasters on local communities is being established.</body></row>

<body>Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts at Brooklyn College will dedicate its upcoming March 6 at 8 p.m. and March 7 at 2 p.m. performances by the National Dance Theatre Company of Jamaica (NDTC) to the memory of the company’s Founding Artistic Director, Rex Nettleford, who passed away February 2, 2010.NDTC returns to Brooklyn next month with a new generation of young artists who, since the ensemble’s last visit two years ago, have come to embody the company’s dual principles of renewal and continuity, working to integrate a strong hold on the ancestral legacy of Jamaican music, movement and rituals with a ready response to contemporary life.The repertoire includes Tintinnabulum, a social-commentary piece on sons and mothers, peer group pressure and youth violence created by Nettleford, who was principle choreographer for the company. Both presentations will end with the New York premiere of another piece by Nettleford entitled “Apocalypse,” which explores the anguish and the hope of contemporary Caribbean life.Using the traditional ritual of Zion Revivalism, a community bypasses traditional law enforcement and instead invokes ancestral spirituality to reform the violence-prone wrongdoer.Shows will be at the Walt Whitman Theatre at Brooklyn College, 2900 Campus Road. For more, call 718-951-4500. Tickets are $40 and $30.</body></row>

Here is his email:Whole Food for Thought!A large section of bulkhead ( approximately 20-25ft span) broke offWhole Foods site and is floating in the Gowanus Canal.The on-going erosion and this level of exposure, which has beenoccurring for over a year, is contributing to further migration oftoxins between the Gowanus Canal and the uplands section at Whole Foods site.Ludger K Balan, Executive, Environmental Program DirectorThe Urban Divers Estuary ConservancyWWW.URBANDIVERS.ORGThis should certainly be addressed at Monday night's meeting with Executives from Whole Foods.Information about the meeting here.For Home Page, click   Pardon Me For Asking</body></row>

<body>You Tube Video Of Ghost Hunter Visits Roosevelt Island Small Pox Hospital (Part 1)Roosevelt Island's Renwick Ruins Smallpox Hospital at Southpoint Park continues to hold an odd attraction for many residents and visitors alike. Bloggers such as Bespoke Affairs write: It's been awhile since I have visited Roosevelt Island...something about it has always creeped me out (a bit). Even before I ever became a &quot;wedding planner&quot;, I was oddly drawn to Renwick Ruins and the idea of doing a photo shoot there......Any photographers out there want to jump the fence and risk getting arrested? Well...I don't want to get arrested!!...You might not want to try and jump the fence to get a closer look because something unfortunate may have happened to folks at Urban Omnibus that they don't want to talk about: ... wicked cool ruins of the Renwick Smallpox hospital – we learned the hard way not to try to sneak in – on the southern tip of the island....Ghost Stories and Haunted Places adds to the Renwick Ruins Smallpox Hospital spookiness and mystery: ...the island was also the site of a Smallbox Hospital, which housed small pox patients from 1856 until 1886.   The intense suffering that went on in this building added to it's ruined state have built numerous rumors about it's ghostly activity.  The ruined hospital is now known as the Renwick Ruin and is brightly lit at night giving it a ghostly glow that only adds to stories....Then there was the Ghost Hunter, Fox News radio's Spencer Hughes who, after waiting in the early morning hours before the Southpoint Park gate opened:You  Tube Video Of Ghost Hunter Visits Roosevelt Island's Southpoint Parkfound the &quot;motherlode&quot; at Southpoint's Renwick Ruins: ...A sign explains how this was home to those spilled over from poorhouses, prisons, and “lunatic” asylums. It opened in 1832. I conducted some respectful EVP sessions (looking for electronic voice phenomenon, or spirit voices…voices not heard with the ear but picked up on recording devices) before continuing the short walk to the Ruins of Renwick. What an amazing site. It looks like a gothic castle just sitting there, decaying from the passage of time. An effort is under way to stabilize the structure before it collapses completely. I did some more EVP work along the perimeter, just on the other side of the chain link fence that keeps the curious from breaking their neck exploring the actual building....You Tube Video Of Ghost Hunter Visits Roosevelt Island Small Pox Hospital (Part 2)That's why some people are fascinated by Roosevelt Island and the Renwick Ruins.One of the items on the Agenda for Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation's (RIOC) February 18 meeting has to do with the stabilization of the Renwick Ruins Smallpox Hospital.

<body>Most often linked to Brooklyn, MAE WEST moved to Queens (an area still known as &quot;Long Island&quot; then) sometime after 1917 — — when her family secured a modest dwelling in suburban blue-collar Woodhaven, New York.   In 1920, when the census-takers interviewed the household, John West, 53, was engaged as a masseuse, teenage John was clerking at a newspaper, 21-year-old Beverly (though married to Sergei since 1917) was still living with her parents and jobless, and 26-year-old Mae was touring steadily in vaudeville.• •  Blackwell's Island Bridge • •• •  The 59th Street Bridge had opened to the public on 30 March 1909, having cost about $18 million and dozens of lives.  A ceremonial grand opening was held in June 1909.  It was then known as the Blackwell's Island Bridge.  The double cantilevered span, also called the Queensboro Bridge, crosses the East River, connecting Long Island City with Manhattan, passing over the once bustling Women's Workhouse on this curious spit of land that had also housed a hospital and a lunatic asylum.• • Thanks to this graceful steel swan, Long Island acreage that had been farmland, cemeteries, and swamps became growing neighborhoods accessible by the streetcar, trolley, bicycle, railways, and the automobile.• •  As a working actress, Mae West crossed this bridge dozens of times as she returned to the parental abode after a performance.  Encouraged by her mother, during March 1921 Mae mailed her slim playscript &quot;The Ruby Ring&quot; to the Library of Congress.  At 20 pages, this manuscript was more of an extended &quot;sketch&quot; than a play. Gloria, the female lead, is a man-trap who is able to pick the gents off with ease.• • Her family was still living there in 1922 when 29-year-old Mae added a full-length play — — &quot;The Hussy&quot; — — to these Washington, DC archives.  Nona, the female lead, likes generous fellows who demonstrate their devotion to a gal by dropping jewelry on her.• • But a different path in late January 1927 would lead to events that took the ambitious trouper across the span with other inmates to the Women's Workhouse.• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • •• •  Roosevelt Island — — At one point in time, New York City exported most of its problems to Roosevelt Island, now a cozy off-shore town, explains Amanda Cormier. The small strip of land in the East River  — — known first as Blackwell’s Island, then Welfare Island in 1921, and Roosevelt Island in 1973  — — housed some of the city’s most famous “undesirables” in its penitentiary:  Boss Tweed, Mae West, and Billie Holiday, who served a four-month term for prostitution charges.• • “The river became the place where they put all sorts of public institutions,” says Edwin Burrows, professor of history at Brooklyn College, holder of a doctorate from Columbia, and Pulitzer Prize-winning author of “Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898.”  He adds, “It wasn’t until the early 1940s and 1950s that it became prime real estate.” ....— — Excerpt: — —• • Article: &quot;Reconstructing History — — professors speak on New York’s forgotten buildings and blocks• • BY: Amanda Cormier | Columnist• • Published by The Eye | The Columbia Daily Spectator — — eye.columbiaspectator.com• • Published on: 28 January 2010• • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • •• •  Come up and see Mae every day  online: http://MaeWest.blogspot.com/________Source:http://maewest.blogspot.com/atom.xmlMae West• • Photo: • • Mae  West • • none • •• • Feed — — http://feeds2.feedburner.com/MaeWestNYCMae  West.</body></row>

<body>I was looking through the Recovery.gov web site looking to see if any Roosevelt Island infrastructure projects have received Federal Stimulus/Recovery funds provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.There were no infrastructure project awards for  Roosevelt Island. However, Roosevelt Island Associates (Manhattan Park) was awarded more than $4 Million in Federal Stimulus Money for what is described as rental assistance payments through HUD. Under the category of Projects and Jobs Information, the Award Summary states:Jobs Created 58.00 andNo new jobs created; retention of administrative management and maintenance staffI inquired of Congresswomen Maloney's office if she had any comment on this matter and was told by a member of her office that she was aware of this award for Section 8 Housing Vouchers, voted for it but did not apply for it. When I asked whether this was the most appropriate use of spending Federal Stimulus Funds on Roosevelt Island her staff member asked me if I had anything against Section 8 housing. I responded that I did not but thought there were plenty of infrastructure improvements that could be made here on Roosevelt Island which could create some new jobs.I asked RIOC President Steve Shane to comment and he replied: No comment on Federal Government's characterization of money for Manhattan Park. I don't know what it's for.No other stimulus money received for RI as far as I know.More information on how the Stimulus funds are being used is available from NY State, NYC City and from Pro Publica, an independent watch dog group following the money trail.</body></row>

Fernando Martinez of RIOC will make a presentation on why they think Main Street should be one way.  At last month's meeting, I explained their ideas and several of you had concerns, so I asked RIOC if they would present at the January meeting.  Mr. Martinez will be first in the public session.  The presentation and discussion should be about 20-30 minutes.  Considering we have a very light agenda otherwise, I think we have room for Mr. Martinez' presentation.2.  Regaring the MTA discussion, although I could discuss this in the President's report, I would like to address this under the Planning Committee agenda item.  I think we need to determine RIRA's next steps, including a written response to the MTA.3.  Matt Katz will report on the RI Bridge.4.  Rachel Reid Chung asks: I was hoping you could add to new business a discussion regarding a resolution from RIRA  regarding placing a fence of some sort to segragate the swings from the rest of the toddler playground in southtown.  I had mentioned the danger to Rosina Abramson a while back and she sent me an email saying she would like a recommendation from RIRA before proceeding.  I have never proposed a resolution before but I guess I will try to write one and have it ready for the meeting.  Shall I send it to you before the meeting?  [Yes, Rachel, please bring proposed wording.]5.  Steve Marcus asks: Frank - Please leave time to get names for a Pub Purp Committee.  We need to start meeting in a few weeks.6.  Island House and Westview will have annual board of directors elections.  They might need volunteers as election monitors.7.  I'm not sure where this belongs, but is RIRA supportive of the master lease idea from RIOC?  I think this deserves some disucssion.  Can e discuss this in Planning or Island Services.8.  Matt pointed out a couple corrections in the agenda.  I'll bring copies tonight.</body></row>

<body>Image Of 1/10 RIRA Meeting Discussing Budget With RIOC ManagementRoosevelt Island Residents Association President (RIRA) Frank Farance sends the following report to Roosevelt Island residents.1.  That &quot;incredibly smart but annoying Frank Farance&quot;.  This is in the category of If You Can't Laugh At Yourself ....  In the last WIRE issue, long-time resident Nina Lublin was wondering out aloud why we (RIRA, me, both?) don't have the gumption to do Article 78 proceedings to halt further development in Southtown.  I ran into Nina last week and thanked her for compliment.  Regarding Nina's points ...We have enough residents as board members on RIOC and, if there is a will, then things can change.  But even our own resident board members don't seem to make the connections at the right moments: spend $25 million on a tram (when we only need to spend $15 million), now 14 months later it's clear we could have saved $10 million and put the savings to good use to shore up RIOC's finances; RIOC board members had the opportunity to decline Hudson-Related request for an extension for Southtown 7-9, but now they say &quot;Gee, I didn't understand what that vote was about&quot;; yet another year of RIOC board meetings with directors complaining about not having details until last minute or not all, and your fellow resident board members haven't figured out how to vote as a bloc to get the message heard or the procedures changed.2.  I Told You So.  Last year, I complained loudly about RIOCs finances and I worried about their finances.  In 2009, I estimated that RIOC would go bankrupt in about 10 years if Southtown were not completed.  So I was cranky and annoying about RIOC not revealing long-term budgets and about RIOC board members who didn't seem to care as they approved spending over $40 million on this year's budget.  In RIOC's 2011 budget proposal, page 9 (PDF page 11) concerns What If Southtown 7-9 Aren't Built?  On the bottom row of that page you'll see that RIOC cash balance goes from $60 million (2010) to $2 million (2019) to negative $2 million the year after.  RIOC President Steve Shane and RIOC CFO Steve Chironis say that on December 31, 2012 RIOC will assess which way to go on their spending (read: possibly severely curtailing spending).  That $10 million extra we paid for a dual-haul rope tram (rather than a design like the present tram) is really looking like money we should not have spent  — you can thank resident board members for not having a backbone on this one.  By the way, although I am critical of the financial status of RIOC (a long-term issue), I really must compliment Steve Chironis on making the extra effort to work with the residents to better understand the RIOC budget and for providing much of the information requested by RIRA.3.  Transportation Problems with Tram Shutdown.  In short, I might be heading to an Article 78 against the MTA.  While the MTA is a huge opponent, I want to be able to say: I have done everything possible on behalf of the residents to improve transportation.  I'm consulting with attorneys and our elected representatives on the best course of action.  In short, what you read from the MTA in the last WIRE issue is either wrong or poorly researched.  For example, the MTA rejects our suggestion on reserving the first car for Roosevelt Island because there are stairs at Roosevelt Avenue and a high number of passengers at the front of the platform.  The MTA seems purposely un-creative here: if there are problems with the first car, then why not look into reserving the last car?  The MTA didn't look into any alternatives and, yes, the last car would work better because people on the rear of the Roosevelt Avenue platform are largely waiting for E trains, not F trains (see photo 1).Image From Frank FaranceAs another example, the MTA says that occasionally putting an R train on our tracks (so we don't have to wait several F trains to board) is operationally infeasible, yet the MTA can do this in the morning rush, as shown in the attached photo 2.Image From Frank FaranceThe R train, with its relatively em...</body></row>

<body>Aerial View Image Of Blackwell Park From Judith's GalleryWhat's going on with the Blackwell Park Master Plan? The last we heard was that any plan was on hold by the Roosevelt Island Operating Corp (RIOC) until a consensus was reached by the Roosevelt Island community through the Blackwell Park Task Force operating under the auspices of the Roosevelt Island Residents Association (RIRA).Blackwell House and ParkBelow is Roosevelt Island's community consensus on Blackwell Park Master Plan in the form of a RIRA resolution.FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASELet it be known that the following Action was taken at a Meeting of the Common Council of the Roosevelt Island Residents Association on February 3, 2010:RESOLUTION OF THE BLACKWELL PARK SUB-COMMITTEEAdopted by the RIRA Common Council – February 3, 2010Whereas the Roosevelt Island community was invited to participate in the conceptual planning for Blackwell Park, andWhereas a small Task Force, including two RIRA delegates was convened last July for that purpose, andWhereas that Task Force has expanded to include more Islanders who are stakeholders in the Park and/or experts in various aspects of park planning, andWhereas that expanded Task Force has coalesced into the Blackwell Park sub-committee of the RIRA Planning Committee with Matthew Katz and Judy Berdy as co-chairs, andWhereas the sub-committee has been asked to present its findings to Rosina Abramson and RIOC, thereforeWe resolve that the following conclusions be factored into the conceptual and design planning for Blackwell Park:• That changes to Blackwell Park be considered more as renewal and maintenance upgrading rather than rethinking a park that has served the needs of Islanders well for decades.  Less is more.• That the Blackwell Park project be considered in the context of Roosevelt Island park planning as a whole and that budgeting for this project be considered as just one component of the Island’s capital needs.• That the two basketball courts remain in their current positions and will be accessible and barrier-free.  The area between the courts will contain spectator seating.• That the playgrounds for both older and younger children will be in such proximity to one another that parents can monitor children in both from a single vantage point.  This flat area will include seating and stroller storage for those supervising children in the playgrounds.• That a water fountain for children to play in must be included.• That the entrance to these playgrounds will be within Blackwell Park rather than at the periphery for safety and within a controlled space.• That the wholesale moving or removal of mature trees will not be considered but that other landscaping, such as trimming back hedges, will be accomplished.• That the significant slope of the area will be utilized to provide green space for mixed use and to provide an appropriate sledding hill.  Slopes will be wheelchair accessible.• That, to accommodate surface tree roots, an appropriate surface will be found to replace concrete walking areas.• That areas adjacent to the East Channel steam vents will be set aside for exercise equipment.• That no overpass should be considered to the East Channel Promenade.• That an ADA/Landmarks Commission compliant, barrier-free ramp for disabled access to Blackwell House, similar to “Plan A” (as presented to the sub-committee) but including additional area for plantings and endorsed by RIDA, will be included.• That the “Kiley Bosk” area just north of Blackwell House will have room for future food service, including tables and chairs.• That bathroom facilities will be a part of the final plan, either within the Park or adjacent to it at 504 Main Street, if a use for this building that would include public rest rooms can be arrived at prior to the drafting of construction plans.• That components of the old Tram, to be replaced starting in March, will be use to create an industrial sculpture facility preferably at Motorgate, but in any event, will not be placed in Blackwell Park.That the committee shall be included in all subsequent pla...</body></row>

<body>You Tube Video of Snowy Roosevelt Island Tram RideAbove video is a view of the Roosevelt Island Tram not seen in the past - from the rooftop of the new Riverwalk Rental building at 405 Main Street and in the snow. Pretty cool!It looks like some other media outlets are finally picking up the story of the Roosevelt Island Tram shutdown.In addition to the WPIX video above, both NewYorkology and Gothamist have mentioned the soon to be out of service Roosevelt Island Tram. According to NewYorkology: Roosevelt Island Tram — famous for its “Spider-Man” movie cameo as well as stranding real-life riders over the East River in 2006 — is on schedule to shut down March 1 through Aug. 31 for a major modernization project.This past weekend, the Roosevelt Islander blog reported the oft-delayed project is almost ready to begin. The tram is “on schedule for March 1 shutdown,” Roosevelt Island Operating Corporaton President Steve Shane states in a report to island residents reprinted on the blogImage From Vidiot via GothamistNothing yet from the major print papers, NY Times, Daily News or NY Post.At yesterday's RIOC Operations Committee Meeting and the RIRA Town Hall Meeting we learned that:the final trip for the the current Roosevelt Island Tram will take place at 2 AM (will there be a party like the one at Jackson Hole?) on the morning of March 1 and that one of the cabins will be ready to resume operation by mid to late August and the other in early September.the construction plan schedule for the Tram Modernization has been altered slightly. Initially, RIOC and POMA planned working on the Tram Towers on the Roosevelt Island side first, which they say will be easier, in order to gain some experience prior to working on the moe difficult Manhattan side towers. That has changed because RIOC was informed by NYC that the Department of Transportation is scheduled to start working May 15 in the same 59th street area on a water tunnel project. POMA will now work on the Manhattan side Towers first so that there is no conflict with DOT's projected May 15 water tunnel start date.The Manhattan Tram Station booth attendant will be eliminated and replaced with Public Safety Officers at both stations during rush hours as well as 24 hour seven day security cameras.The plan is for all of the current Roosevelt Island Tram workers to be asked back but that there will be reductions due to retirements and attrition.The Q 102 bus to Queens will now make a single loop around Roosevelt Island instead of the current confusing practice of alternate North and South routes coming from the Roosevelt Island Bridge. RIOC President Steve Shane indicated that there is a possibility the Red Bus Shuttle service to Queens may be eliminated if more people use the Q102 than the Red Bus. The number mentioned was that if only 2 to 4 people are using the Red Bus to Queens then the service could be stopped. RIOC Director Margie Smith said she would not approve of that idea.The MTA will provide no additional trains during the tram outage and will continue planned weekend subway work which will eliminate Roosevelt Island subway service in at least one direction at these times.Temporary Ferry Service from the oil dock appears unlikely due to cost but will be voted on at today's RIOC Board Meeting.Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital will be running shuttle bus service for it's employees during Tram outageRIOC will be filming the Tram Modernization process. Maybe a future movie?On a non- tram outage transportation issue, RIOC and RIRA both agreed to provide information and apply to be a test community for Google's new high speed broadband ISP service mentioned in this earlier post.</body></row>

<body>Image From RIOCThe Red Bus Schedule to Queens and Manhattan during the Roosevelt Island Tram outage has been revised as shown in the image below. The new schedule includes an additional Red Bus Stop at the Seniors  Center at 546 Main Street and a 3:30 PM weekday bus shuttle from  Roosevelt Island to Manhattan with a return from Manhattan to Roosevelt  Island at 4 PM.Revised Red Bus Schedule Image From RIOCThe additional afternoon bus shuttle was scheduled for the returning school kids. According to RIOC President Steve Shane: Since the 3:30 bus was added at the special behest of Matt Katz for the returning kids from school, please do whatever that can be done to get the word out to the community. I am presuming that during the months of July and August, will not be necessary as the school kids will either be away at camp or in any event, not attending a Manhattan school.Everything else is the same.During rush hour weekday mornings, the Red Bus Shuttle will pick up passengers in Southtown near the Riverwalk Bar &amp; Grill on the half hour starting at 7 AM until 9:30 AM, stopping 5 minutes later at the Seniors Center (546 Main Street), 5 minutes after that at the Q102 stop across from PS/IS 217 and then proceed to Queens Plaza South and Jackson Avenue where residents can take the E, G, R, V, 7, W, or N subway lines. The shuttle bus trip to Queens subway will take approximately a half hour from Southtown.During non-rush hour weekdays, the Red Bus Shuttle will pick up passengers in Southtown near the Riverwalk Bar &amp; Grill on the hour starting at 10 AM until 2:00 PM, stopping 5 minutes later at the Seniors Center, 5 minutes after that at the Q102 stop across from PS/IS 217 and then proceed to Second Avenue and 59th Street. Return trips from Manhattan will be on the hour starting at 10:30 AM until 2:30 PM. The shuttle bus trip to Manhattan will also take approximately a half hour from Southtown.Between 3-7 PM weekdays there will be no Red Bus Shuttle service to or from Manhattan due to rush hour traffic, except for the 3:30 PM school bus shuttle to and from Manhattan.  The Red Bus Shuttle will resume at 7 PM to Manhattan on the hour until 11 PM with returns from Manhattan starting at 7:30 PM until 11:30 PM.Weekend Red Bus service to Manhattan will be on the hour starting at 10 AM until 11 PM with return trip on the hour starting at 10:30 AM until 11:30 PM.Regular Fares will be $1, Seniors, Disabled and children 5-16 years of age 50 cents.</body></row>

	  				 	 			 				The Village Tart is both a yet to be discovered floozy I will attempt to hook up with at my birthday party tomorrow night, and the name of Leslie Bernard’s new Kenmare Street corner pastry and light fare joint. I had cappuccino and cake with my man yesterday afternoon. It is a triumph. Real estate maestro James Famularo joined us and we exchanged war stories for hours, alternating between Pellegrino and cappuccino. The space is right next door to the Nur/Sevigny offering at 98 Kenmare street, which is under construction. The local yokels on the community board have restricted the hours of operations of the restaurant, which should prevent it from being the next Beatrice, but I don’t think that was ever the intention anyway. 
	 	 Word comes that idle fire marshals are being re-tasked to aid in the smoking crackdown. Apparently the health department doesn’t have enough late night manpower to stop the smoke and the fire department will step up. While five clubs have been targeted and threatened with immediate closing, the rest of clubdom is fighting a semi-successful uphill battle to stop patrons from sneaking a puff. One inspection of a large space this weekend found nary an if, and or butt. The owner told me how “impossible it is to police this, as smokers will stop at nothing to grab a smoke.” Another told me  “Security guards ask them to put out the cigarettes and they just pretend they don’t hear them. We need to start tossing people. But in this economy it’s tough, plus most of the guilty parties are at tables and we’re afraid of charge backs if they are thrown out. “ 


Lastly, I’m inviting people to Lit on 5th street and 2nd avenue for my birthday tomorrow night. Some have inquired, “Why Lit?” They’ve asked, “Why not a place like the Boom Boom Room?” Well, I’m all about diversity. My friends are gay, straight, rich, poor, ugly, pretty, rough, soft, witty and dull. The unpretentious, unfinished beauty of Lit is really me and I hope you will join us. Me and mine will be spending our time deciding whether the Jameson or the Powers  Irish are tastier. This experiment, followed by a great deal of debate, will start around 10ish and end when my head is lower than my feet. Erik Foss is in charge. That says it all

      February 1, 2010. It was very cold and clear and sunny all weekend in New York with temperatures in the low teens.
        
        Friends and connections. Yesterday I called my friend Colette Harron in Essex, Connecticut (where the thermometers were touching zero by mid-evening) to wish her a happy birthday. 
        
I was telling her about a book I’d been reading over the weekend that Richard David Story, the editor of Departures had given me called Beautiful Fall about Yves St. Laurent, Karl Lagerfeld and the fashion crowd that moved between here and London and Paris. When Richard told me about it I wasn’t sure that I’d share his enthusiasm because the fashion business per se is not of great interest to me. However. It was the age of Warhol,  all the liberation movements, of the pop art and contemporary art movement and twenty pages into the book, I knew what Richard was raving about.

      In the book, the author Alicia Drake describes how Loulou de la Falaise became an integral and important part of the St. Laurent-Pierre Berge circle in part because YSL was taken by her Englishness and her improvisational fashion that just reeked style. 
        
      This meeting occurred at a moment when London was the fashion center of the universe. It began with the arrival of the Beatles and they were followed by a fashion revolution. Ossie Clark was at the top of the list.  Colette was telling me that she was very influenced by Ossie, that he was a friend. Although he died in 1996, age 54, his clothes are still highly sought after, and worn by models such as Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell.
      
      It led us to talking about Blair Sabol who now writes her “No Holds Barred” for NYSD and is a new friend for me but an old friend of Colette’s. The two women met in the late 60s/early 70s in New York when Blair was writing a column in the Village Voice called “Outside Fashion.”  Colette had a funky clothing boutique (with no name) on East 9th Street not far from the Fillmore East where all the rockers played. It was a go-to place for the hipsters as well as the rich, the chic and the shameless.

      Colette’s of Moroccan Jewish descent (a “Moroccan Jew,” is how she would put it) grew up mainly in New York with flights of fancy to Paris. So there are several strong notes to her visual senses. Because French was her native language there is also just the lightest hint of it in her speaking. 
        
        We met when I first came back from California in the early 90s, through Lady Sarah Churchill. Sarah had beforehand told me that she wanted me to meet Colette and her husband Peter, a documentary filmmaker and photographer. Sarah liked them so much she thought I would too. She was right.

              Stella Douglas and Colette Mimram practically initiated the leather fringe binge singlehandedly in New York when they opened their shop on 321 East Ninth Street. Colette wears an Ossie Clark original.
                
              Last night before I wrote this Diary I emailed Blair Sabol and asked her to describe Colette at that time when she was a denizen of the Rock World here and in London.  This was her immediate reply:

<body>Augustus Saint-Gauden's Diana twirling overhead on the second and arguably greatest version of Madison Square GardenMadison Square Garden is certainly the recognizable name in arena entertaining, hosting Rangers and Knicks games, concerts, even political conventions. But it inherited that reputation from three other buildings which also called themselves 'Madison Square Garden'.The first, inspired by P.T Barnum and a popular bandleader, staked its claim in the hottest area of New York in the 1870s. The second, a classic designed by the city's most famous architect, featured both trendy new sports and high society events. The third Garden, moving up town, stripped off the glamour and helped make the Garden's sporting reputation.We'll also tell you about the most famous event to ever happen in any Madison Square Garden -- a shocking and brutal murder which led to the 'trial of the century.You can tune into it below, download it for FREE from iTunes or other podcasting services, get it straight from our satellite site.The Bowery Boys: Madison Square GardenPre-Garden: It was all Barnum, with his spectacular tented Roman Hippodrome.Madison Square Garden I, built for William Kissam Vanderbilt, grandson of Cornelius Vandebilt.

<body>The Garden’s March women’s tennis extravaganza in nine days underwent a crippling blow when Serena Williams pulled out today, claiming she has an undisclosed leg injury from her Australian Open championship. 
Former French Open champion Ana Ivanovic, whose career has skidded, was added to replace Williams. 
The BNP Paribas Showdown, to be held March 1, was being billed as a rematch of the Williams-Kim Clijsters U.S. Open semifinals that ended in Serena’s wild tantrum on a lineswoman. 
Williams’ injury also has forced Williams out of WTA events in Paris and Dubai. Ivanovic will replace Williams in the draw resulting in semifinal pairings of Ivanovic vs. Clijsters and Svetlana Kuznetsova vs. Venus Williams. 
&quot;I’m very disappointed I won’t be able to compete in the Billie Jean King Cup this year,&quot; said Williams in a statement. &quot;I loved playing in this event last year and was really looking forward to returning to New York and Madison Square Garden. Unfortunately I am still recovering from my leg injury in Australia and am not quite ready to compete at the highest level. I wish the event a great success and look forward to seeing my fans in New York in the fall.&quot; 
Actually, the U.S. Open is in late-summer but Williams is no guarantee, as she will be banned from the event if she has another major eruption, according to the terms of her Flushing punishment. 
Williams was to face Clijsters for the first time since the Open semis. 
Ivanovic, who competed in last year’s BNP Showdown for the Billie Jean King Cup, is a former World No. 1 player and captured the 2008 French Open Championship. Earlier this month, Ivanovic was one of the featured athletes in Sports Illustrated’s annual swimsuit issue. She was voted No. 11 in the 2009 FHM Sexiest Women in the World Poll, and is nominated for that same list in 2010.</body></row>

<body>Zach Randolph said he thinks fellow All-Star LeBron James just might head to the Knicks this summer — with New York City and Madison Square Garden serving as the prime attractions. 
Randolph, the former Knicks forward, was dealt to the Clippers in November 2008, as team president Donnie Walsh decided to start clearing cap space. Now with the Grizzlies, Randolph said before last night’s 120-109 Memphis win that the Knicks’ cap-clearing dumps of him and Jamal Crawford — among others — may end up being justified after all should James make the Garden his new home.
“It’s a good chance he will,” Randolph said. “Just the city, playing in the Garden. It’s going to be interesting, though. It’ll be interesting.” 
How much Randolph — who annihilated the Knicks with 31 points and a career-high 25 rebounds — actually knows about James’ intentions, of course, is pretty debatable. But the big man does have experience playing here, spent a short time playing for coach Mike D’Antoni (whom he called “great”) and has established himself as an All-Star on a possible playoff team. 
Told how much the personnel has changed here since he was traded, Randolph asked: “What are they trying to do? Who are they trying to get? They’re trying to get Bron 
Bron, huh? 
“But if they don’t get him, then I wonder [about their cap-clearing trades]. I don’t know.” 
Randolph said if the Knicks don’t land James, they would have screwed up by dealing away him, Crawford and others. Asked about the potential for a Randolph-David Lee-Crawford Knicks core, Randolph whistled. 
“We’d be tough, man,” he said.
Randolph himself was tough last night. He almost out-rebounded the Knicks’ entire team, his 25 falling just a bit short of their 32. 
“He’s relentless,” Al Harrington said.

<body>Many a great artist has died in obscurity or, perhaps even worse, found a glorious peak early in life only to face horrific ruin in the final years of life.Few have embodied this as dramatically and sadly as the great Louis Sullivan.  In 1890 when, at the age of 34, he unveiled the Auditorium Building, he was introducing to the world the most tremendous man-made structure on earth up to that time.  At 17-stories, it was the world's tallest building.  At 110,000 tons, it was the heaviest building in the world and had over eight million cubic feet of space.When Sullivan died on April 14, 1924, died penniless, his friends coming up with $600 for his funeral and the six months past rent due the Hotel Warner where he whiled away his final days in a small, pathetic room of no architectural distinction.  Those who don't believe in a resurrection or an after life need only look at the sudden returning praise of his work after years of being out of fashion and his surviving buildings for which there is a tactile afterlife for his vision and imagination.   There may not be a heaven where the dead may go, but Sullivan left behind bits of heaven for those living after he died.The pathetic last days of his life belie the fact that he did not find ways out of the hell of his final quarter of a century.   What is not widely known that cats watch over fallen artists and taken them out of their quandary both in life and afterward.  Though suspicious of the international style, Sullivan was no fuddy duddy.   He was particularly fond of the work of Jim Flora, who was ten years old when Sullivan died and did not come into his full stride until the 1940s.  He had a reputation of drawing hepcats that were cute -- and deadly.But some nights in the teens and twenties -- and even some nights today when the spirit of Sullivan is feeling blue and in search of inspiration -- the cats come to him and transport him into paintings and rooms filled with the work of Flora.  This commercial modernist came to greatest note designing covers of RCA and Columbia record albums primarily after the Second World War, a conflict Sullivan did not have to live to endure.Though he died at the dawn of the Jazz Age, Sullivan was no square to swing and cool, and many nights he can be found swinging with the cats in some room designed by Flora.   The creative spirit may come to mold a tower or sculpture or play or &quot;So What&quot;, but more often it is still swinging out there beyond the lifetime of the creator, sometimes capturing the imagination of someone today who has no idea of its source.Just before he died, Sullivan felt compelled to write a third book, The Autobiography of an Idea in which Louis Sullivan writes of Louis Sullivan in the third person while the idea tells his story in the first person:&quot;That IDEA which had its mystical beginning in so small a thing as a child's heart, grew and nurtured itself upon that child's varied consistently continuing and metamorphosing experiences in time and place, as has been most solicitously laid bare to view in detail, in the course of this recital.  For it needs a long, long time, and a rich soil of life-experience to enable a simple, single idea to grow to maturity and solid strength.  A French prover has it that 'Time will not consecrate that in which it has been ignored,'  while the deep insight of Whitman is set forth in the line, 'Nature neither hastens nor delays.'</body></row>

If the plan isn't approved following a trial next month, however, a group of noteholders could submit an alternative.Under Six Flags' plan, holders of senior secured notes issued by Six Flags Operations Inc., a subsidiary, would receive about 93% of the equity in the reorganized company.Holders of junior notes issued by Six Flags Inc. would receive only about 5% of new equity under the company's plan. They claim to have lined up $1.8 billion in financing for an alternative plan that would increase the recovery for creditors.</body></row>

<body>While running from the Full House house to the Mrs. Doubtfire house and delivering sick hummingbirds (OK... hummingbird) to the animal hospital, we needed caffeine and a lot of fast snacks. Luckily there are tons of great spots all over the city, and Rob mapped a few of them out so we could visit quickly as we shuttled along.I had the first iced coffee of 2010 at Cafe Murano, a cute neighborhood wifi spot on Steiner Street. Tasted like good high-quality coffee, but with too much ice it was a little watered down too fast. It was definitely refreshing after a hike up the hill to Alta Plaza, a quiet little park with a great view of the city.Cafe Murano1777 Steiner Street (between Post St &amp; Sutter St)San Francisco, CA  94115(415) 771-0888That afternoon we were stuck in touristy Fisherman's Wharf, with no viable food options beyond a Bubba Gump Shrimp. I did a quick search on Yelp and found a highly rated Argentinean truck called Tanguito with quiet off-strip outdoor seating. Score! We shared a fresh, flaky ham and cheese empanada, then we each had two huge sandwiches on French bread. My steak sandwich had peppers, onions, mushrooms and a fantastic homemade chimichurri sauce; Rob had a sausage sandwich with similar toppings.  We were only looking for a late afternoon snack, but it was so much food we were good for the rest of the day... until we made our way to Ghirardelli Square.I know it sounds gimmicky and touristy but I really think this was the best hot fudge sundae I've ever had. The homemade chocolate chip ice cream was thick, creamy, actual good vanilla with lots of chips, topped with melted dark Ghirardelli chocolate, heavy whipped cream and walnuts. I could have sat by the fountain people watching with this sundae all night.Rob had the sea salt caramel hot chocolate. I didn't find it all that salty or caramelly but then again I was pretty engrossed in the sundae.Ghirardelli Square900 N Point StSan Francisco, CA 94109(415) 775-5500      The next day, after an afternoon at the Botanical Gardens, we headed over to Arizmendi Bakery for a coffee and snack. Every day they have a special pizza (this particular day it was artichokes, tomatoes, basil and rosemary oil) that people seem to go crazy for; they actually ran out while we were visiting and a lot of disappointed customers ensued. They also specialize in pastries and breads, all of which looked fresh and enticing. We finally decided on a cheddar scone. Wow. Hard, crunchy sections of cheddar melted along the sides, contrasted well with the softer insides, ended with a nice spice from red pepper. I wish we had time to try more here... but we had places to go.Arizmendi Bakery 1331 9th Ave (between Irving St &amp; Judah St) San Francisco, CA  94122 (415) 566-3117      One day we got up ridiculously early to rent a car and head up to Oakland and eventually Napa. A block down the street from our hotel was a little cafe called Em's Place with very decent coffee and fairly awesome breakfast sandwiches. I had an egg and cheese on a cheese bagel, it was too cheesy to even take a picture. Rob's ham, bacon and egg sandwich held up much better under the poppyseed bagel and made a great Bay Bridge car breakfast.Em's Place 154 McAllister St (at Hyde St)  San Francisco, CA  94102(415) 552-8379      While driving through Napa we looped around through Yountville so I could see the French Laundry in the flesh (er.. stone?). Just down the street is Thomas Keller's Bouchon Bakery, which also exists in New York at Columbus Circle. They have a few good sandwiches here, like the turkey with cranberry. They don't stuff the sandwiches all that much -- it was only about a single slice of turkey -- but the bread is so freshly baked that it doesn't really matter that it makes up 85% of the whole sandwich. They'll even toast it for you too if you aren't in a rush.The most impressive part of this bakery though, is the macarons. I'm embarrassed to say that I was a macaron virgin before Yountville, and this place has turned me into a full-fledged believer. Or have I just been ruined for macarons? Dam...</body></row>

<body>- Gela Nash-Taylor and Pamela Skaist-Levy, the co-founders of the much-mocked-but-ridiculously-profitable Juicy Couture, are officially leaving the company. The duo sold the brand to Liz Claborne in 2003 and have made a fortune (more than $200 million) since then, but apparently they're looking to &quot;do other things.&quot; The rumor was that the two weren't happy with the new direction the company's been taking under the parent company, which has been struggling of late, but the two insist the're working on a TV show, a book, and a movie. [NY Post]- A tipster reports a Target sign facing the FDR in East Harlem that reads &quot;opening July 2010,&quot; but also wonders: &quot;Can Costco hold out that long?&quot; We wonder, too. [Racked]- Cindy Crawford's latest cover for Harper's Bazaar proves the supermodel's not only still got it, she blows pretty much everyone else away. [Fab Sugar]- J. Crew is selling men's Levi's 501 jeans in exclusive washes online and in stores. We've got to admit, Levi's is just one of those classic brands that we'll never, ever get tired of. We're considering snapping up a few pairs in the smaller sizes for ourselves! [J. Crew]- We're not entirely sure what the next act will be for wunderkind Olivier Theyskens, but apparently he has three or four collections completely ready to go, down to the chosen fabrics. [WSJ]- Fashion Week hasn't even started yet and the Post is already naming the club that everyone will be going to: soon-to-open Good Units at the Hudson Hotel. [NY Post]</body></row>

<body>It was a rather well-kept secret that deep in the belly of the Hudson Hotel there was once a YMCA, complete with a basketball court and a track. But as of Interview's 40th anniversary party last night, the story is out. Good Units, as the club is called, is now open for business, and with its subterranean allure, it will no doubt become one of New York fashion week's hot spots. Despite Topper Mortimer likening it to the now defunct raver club the Tunnel, the reviews were good. &quot;I can remember when this hotel opened, but I've never been down here,&quot; said Naomi Campbell, who has some pretty extensive club research under her Ala?a belt. &quot;I love it, though. I love the dancing?it reminds me of the eighties.&quot; How's this for a flashback? The unfinished basement space didn't have cell phone reception. &quot;Yeah,&quot; joked Interview chairman Peter Brant, &quot;so people will actually have to talk to each other.&quot;—Derek Blasberg</body></row>

<body>When the Knicks take the court for their customary Martin Luther King matinee at the Garden on Monday, they will be facing more than just the Pistons. They'll be facing themselves, their upcoming schedule and the lingering stench of the past as they reach the halfway point in the season.The lingering stench was hard to miss this weekend as the Knicks lost a pair of games to the Raptors and Pistons. The Knicks fell right into their pattern from the first 10 games by falling way behind in the first three quarters and trying to mount a comeback in the final minutes. The cohesion and flow of their recent wins was nowhere to be found and now they've lost four of the last five games and fallen back in their playoff push. That segues nicely into why that bad start is still lingering. Assuming they win Monday, they'll be 17-24 entering the final 41 games of the season. If we set 36 wins as the barrier, that leaves 19 wins for the Knicks to pick up against a schedule that is loaded with tough games. Two trips to Cleveland, a five-game road swing featuring games at San Antonio, Dallas and Boston and another five-game trip to the west coast. There's another trip to Boston, a game in Orlando and, well, you get the point. The schedule gets rough right away, in fact, with games against the Lakers and Mavericks this weekend. A loss to the Pistons Monday opens the door to a five-game losing streak and, suddenly, the playoffs will seem as far away as they did at the start of the season.Beating the Pistons may not wind up changing that, but the Knicks need to get right and they need to get right quickly.</body></row>

Sure he posts specials and upcoming event announcements, but also recaps of previous nights, anecdotes, photos, things over heard at the bar, and other random notes.   Or as Curtis describes it, &quot;the daily interactions of an affable bar manager of a pretty cool and not-so-typical watering hole in NYC, in a not-so-typical neighborhood, Murray Hill.&quot;So check it out at http://diaryofthirdandlong.blogspot.com and if you like what you see, head over to the bar, have some drinks and check out what it is all about.Cheers!Third &amp; Long523 Third Ave. (35th St.)New York, NY(212) 447-5711ThirdandLongNYC.com</body></row>

<body>By Meredith DelisoFrom the Tuesday open mics at Bar 4 to the welcoming environment of Goodbye Blue Monday, Brooklyn’s music scene is one of communities.One that’s been going promoting local talent for the last five years has been the Brooklyn Songwriters Exchange (BSE), which, after being hosted by Vox Pop in Flatbush and the Brooklyn Lyceum in Park Slope, now has a home nearby at Union Hall.And, on January 18, it kicks off its first show of 2010, a night of alternative Americana that also doubles as the release party for the series’ first (of what founder Rebecca Pronsky (pictured) hopes to be many) sampler, a mix that culls from the borough’s burgeoning and established crop of singer-songwriters.“I wanted it to be as eclectic as possible,” says Pronksy, a Park Slope native who founded the BSE in 2005 as a way to promote local talent. Among the 14 tracks is a song off her latest album, the EP “Best Game in Town,” out this past spring. “I picked the artists that have played the series and made an impression on me and on the audience. I do have a lot of artists from out of town, so I wanted to keep it local for the sampler (as well).”One of those local artists is Greenpoint-based musician Jason Myles Goss, a Massachusetts native who met Pronsky not in Brooklyn but in Cambridge during a songwriter festival several years ago. They kept in touch, and he wound up playing the series when it was at Vox Pop in what was one of his first shows in New York. He was invited back for the January 18 show and the sampler, which includes “Mississippi Red,” a song off his third album, “A Plea for Dreamland,” out this past summer.“I was approaching it the same way you’d pick a single – something that would summarize what the project was like,” says Goss of his selection for the sampler. “My newest record sounds like a first, because a lot of my own writing has changed quite a bit since I got here. I started to take more from rootsy songwriters I was listening to a lot, like Gillian Welch, people who would write music that wasn’t in the traditional pop style.”Another Welch fan is Annie Crane, a Bushwick-based singer-songwriter joining Pronksy and Goss on the January 18 bill. In the midst of promoting her debut full-length, “Through the Farmlands &amp; the Cities,” Crane is a newbie to the BSE, and, since moving to the city three years ago from upstate New York, has immersed herself in similar communities, hanging out at local haunts like Brooklyn Tea Party and Northeast Kingdom.“It’s a huge city and you can often feel lost,” says Crane. “But there are absolutely little pockets of people that are doing the same thing you’re doing and who can help you out. I’m really excited to play on the Songwriters Exchange to get to know some new musicians.”Feel free to do the same yourself, when the Brooklyn Songwriters Exchange kicks off the new year January 18 at Union Hall (702 Union St.) at 8 p.m. in a round with Jason Myles Goss, Annie Crane, Rebecca Pronsky and Maia Macdonald.All BSE shows are free, and are monthly on Mondays at Union Hall The BSE sampler will be available for free at all shows and at spots in the neighborhood.</body></row>

<body>From the February issue: Nothing says progress like Madoff. Late last month, The Real Deal broke the story that the Ponzi schemer's Upper East Side penthouse finally appears close to a sale.
Listing brokers Anne Corey and Serena Boardman of Sotheby's
International Realty have told interested agents that there is an
accepted offer on the 133 East 64th Street duplex. At press time, the
U.S. Marshals Service, which seized the property from the disgraced
financier, said the listing had not yet entered contract.
The sale (if it does clear the many obstacles of today's market) may not be unqualified good news.
The penthouse's asking price is $8.9 million, following a November
price chop of $1 million. It's also been sitting on the market since
September.? [more]</body></row>

<body>In response to the Health Department's new salt reduction initiative, the Times ordered some food from local restaurants and sent it off to a Long Island lab for sodium testing. What they found may not shock you: A Double ShackBurger, fries and a peanut butter shake from Shake Shack contain 1,980 milligrams of sodium. Two slices of Cajun bacon-cheeseburger pizza from Two Boots clock in at 2,240 milligrams. But the saltiest of them all is the corned beef sandwich from Katz's Deli, which contains 4,490 milligrams of sodium. Considering that the FDA recommends a maximum of 2,400 milligrams of sodium per day, &quot;having what she's having&quot; might just leave you with hypertension.</body></row>

Favorite spots in the city?&quot;So many! I love Veselka diner on Ninth St. I love the Bowery Hotel, Benny's Burritos and B&amp;H Dairy on Second Ave. ? the best soup in NYC. I love the fancy shmancy Reebok Club uptown. I love all the new standup rooms in Brooklyn. There is this bar in Park Slope called Union Hall and they have a really fun standup show in the basement there I like to do ... I could really go on forever.&quot;
Ok, so not exactly &quot;us&quot; as in Park Slope, but she did give a shoutout to Union Hall! Though, actually it wasn't even really a shoutout to Union Hall as much as it was a shoutout to Eugene Mirman's Sunday night comedy show Tearing the Veil of Maya.

<body>The Times writes about White Slab Palace on Delancey and Allen today....And let's start the piece:THE Lower East Side has become a destination for those from other boroughs, other towns and other nations who seek a few hours of Manhattan life. On a recent Saturday night, on Rivington Street between Essex and Ludlow, it was easy to find people from Queens, Brooklyn, Staten Island, England and Germany. It was harder to find a local resident. Nearby, a stretch limousine idled, its passenger area illuminated by a black light and filled with champagne glasses. Inside, Luis Salcedo, the driver, waited for his evening’s charges — eight people from Queens. Mr. Salcedo said he was often called to drive to the area. “They always sing songs on the way,” he added. And!“The greasy dude factor is low here,” said Sam Sellers, one of the resident D.J.’s. “You can play reggae and the guys aren’t grinding up all over the girls. It’s parties of friends, not one or two or three people looking for a night, so the energy is amazing.”Celebrity sighting bonuse: David Schwimmer!Anyway, stretch limos, greast dudes...yes, yes... But, oddly enough, no mention of the falling caribou/moose/dead animal head here!

<body>With fashion-forward starlets like Selma Blair, Mary-Kate Olsen, Chloe Sevigny, and Nicole Richie in the front row, Proenza Schouler offered up its take on an updated schoolgirl look on Wednesday night: buttoned-up, moody, and graphic, complete with the requisite '90s thigh-high stockings.Frankly, the first thought that popped into our heads as the parade of dark-lipped, pleated skirt-and-buttoned-up collar-clad models started parading down the runway was: It's like Heathers meets Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but with Cher from Clueless's budget. It really does seem that the New York scene's leading roster of young talent -- Proenza Schouler and Alexander Wang being the most notable examples -- have taken their cues from the cult late-'80s, early-'90s schoolgirl set, from a cheeky take on a letter jacket (in this case, a fur-collared coat with white letter jacket-looking sleeves) to a goth-inspired, Buffy-ish  black pleated skirt paired with a sheer black buttoned-up blouse and black thigh-highs.As with all Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez's collections for Proenza, the collection is diverse but cohesive: Eclectic prints from florals to ikat comingle with velvet and leather, and yet the schoolgirl-like silhouettes (pleated skirts, tea party collars and V-neck sweaters) keep it all together. There was also an abundance of bold print-mixing, which is clearly the trend we're most interested in experimenting with for fall -- though it may take us a bit more courage to get ready to embrace the sheer thigh-highs again.</body></row>

<body>Special election called for 44TH Council District
The special election to fill Simcha Felder’s seat is set for Tuesday, March 23. 
Mayor Michael Bloomberg set the date following Felder’s official resignation effective Feb. 1, to work as Deputy City Comptroller under John Liu.
The open election thus far will feature Democrats David Greenfield and Joe Lazar, and Republican Jonathan Judge.
The district includes Borough Park, Bensonhurst and Midwood.
Pol’s son loses pants!
“Pants on the ground! Pants on the ground! Lookin’ like a fool with your pants on the ground!”
Seems like State Senator Velmanette Montgomery has the same complaint as “American Idol” sensation Larry Platt.
At a community meeting about parenting, the pol admitted that her kid is just another teenager wearing his waistband around his thighs.
“When he’s home, his pants are up,” Montgomery told a packed house at Long Island University. “When he goes back to college in Atlanta, his pants are hanging down and he lives like a slob.”
Maybe Montgomery should borrow another line from Platt’s tune – “Get it up, hey! Get your pants off the ground!”
Harold Ford comes back for seconds
Looks like Senate candidate Harold Ford Jr. can’t get enough of Williamsburg’s Italian food.
Neither can Kings County Democratic Party leaders.
State legislators, Council members, and district leaders from across the borough came to the table at Cono’s O’Pescatore Restaurant (301 Graham Avenue) on January 29 to meet Ford and determine his worth as a prospective Senate candidate with their own eyes. 
Borough President Marty Markowitz, State Senators Eric Adams (D-Park Slope), Carl Kruger (D-Mill Basin), and Martin Dilan (D-Williamsburg), Assemblymembers Karim Camara (D-Crown Heights), Hakeem Jeffries (D-Clinton Hill), Joan Millman (D-Boerum Hill), and Council members Steve Levin (D-Williamsburg), Domenic Recchia (D-Coney Island) Erik Dilan (D-Bushwick) and Jumaane Williams (D-Flatbush) joined Assemblymember Vito Lopez (D-Williamsburg), who hosted Ford at the Williamsburg restaurant for the second time in a week.
While few declared their commitments towards a candidate who has not even formally announced his own intentions to run for Senate, by the end of the lunch, Lopez was beaming. 
Though he did not rule out sitting down with Senator Kirsten Gillibrand at a later date, Lopez said that Ford performed at a “98 out of 100” in front of Brooklyn’s political leaders. He also secured a commitment from Ford to come to the Ridgewood Bushwick Senior Center, which Lopez founded, at Thanksgiving to help serve meals to several hundred seniors later this year. 
“One way or another, on Thanskgiving, I’ll be serving the seniors,” said Ford.
“Oily” lunch
It seems that Ford didn’t wow everybody at Cono’s during Friday’s lunch.
As the would be U.S. Senate candidate hobnobbed with Brooklyn legislators at the famed eatery, LGBT activist Jon Winkleman -- who was lying in wait the entire time -- jumped up and started screaming at Ford about his sudden change of heart on gay marriage.
“Anti-choice, anti-gay, snake oil Harry go away,” Winkleman screamed as he held up a homemade placard.
Winkleman was paying homage to the “snake-oil salesman” monicker given to Ford by former Empire State Pride Agenda executive director Alan van Capelle, who questioned how the Tennessee congressman could vote twice for the federal marriage amendment (which put up a roadblock against gay marriage) and now say is he’s for marriage equality.
Ford didn’t go away. Rather, it was Winkleman who was thrown out of the restaurant. And while Ford said nothing to the protestor, the guard that “escorted” Winkleman had a lot to say.
“Get the f--k out of here...I knew you were up to no f--king good you f--king hard on!” the man screamed as he grabbed Winkleman and kicked him to the curb.
If you prick us, do we not bleed?

<body>Kianna Beckles, 13, of Canarsie, looking radiant and confident, gave a toothy smile as she stood just outside the dressing room.
“My favorite diva is Beyonce because she has that fierceness that every diva should have,” said Beckles as her mother, Nadine Juste-Beckles, looked on. “Anybody can be fierce. You have to have that attitude.”
So it went for dozens of girls aged a few months to 15 as they competed in the fourth annual National Darling Divas Pageant, held Jan. 23 at Long Island University’s Brooklyn Campus’ Kumble Theater for the Performing Arts.
The pageant featured the girls strutting their stuff on stage to recorded music as judges rated them on several criteria and audience members, mainly made up of family, cheered them on.
The Darling Divas Pageant was started by Cheryl Williams from East Flatbush to bring the joys of pageantry to the Brooklyn community. Starting with 16 girls in 2007, the recent pageant hosted 62 girls and several boys.
In its four years, the pageant now attracts contestants from all over New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Florida and as far away as Tortolla, Virgin Islands. 
“Contestants compete in Introduction, Beauty and Outfit of Choice (contestants four and under are scored on personality in place of introduction), all trying to win the Ultimate Grand Supreme title with a prize package that includes a large crown, jeweled embroidered sash, large trophy, gift and $500 cash,” said Williams
The Ultimate Grand Supreme winner was three-year-old Kylie LaDuca from Pennsylvania. Winning Novice Supreme titles were two-year-old Bryanna Garnes from Ditmas Park West, Keanna Wharwood from East New York and Anika Abraham from Brownsville. Each won a prize package that includes a large crown, jeweled embroidered sash, large trophy, gift and $150 cash. Contestants also competed in optional events that include Photogenic, Themewear and the crowd favorite, Living Doll. Contestants choose their favorite doll and then “become” that doll. This year’s winner was two-year-old Bryanna Garnes (as a Panama Doll), second place went to Paige Fitzgerald (as a ballerina doll) and Tiara Browne-Seale (as an Alvin Ailey doll).
While all contestants leave with at least a crown, trophy and gifts, they all seemed to be enjoying themselves looking and acting like divas, Brooklyn style.
“Being a diva is about being yourself, but making that inner shine come out,” said Browne-Seale, 12, of Canarsie, but who attends Bay Academy in Coney Island. “My favorite diva is Lady Gaga because she’s really unusual and different with her music and style.”

<body>They'll be freaking out in Coney Island this summer. 
Sideshow operator John Strong said yesterday that his show will return this summer, but in new digs: the ex-Grashorn's Hardware building site on Surf Avenue, which dates back to the 1880s and is Coney Island's oldest building. 
Strong, who leased part of the former Astroland site from developer Joe Sitt last season before it was sold to the city, also cut his new deal with Sitt. 
Sitt through a spokesperson declined to say the deal to bring Strong back is done but said he “would be thrilled to have” Strong “and his wild oddities back this summer, as we launch our exciting partnership with the City of New York to revitalize Coney Island.” 
Sitt in November agreed to sell the Astroland site and some other Coney Island property he owns to the city, so it could go forward with plans to build a new amusement park and other attractions.
Strong said he is also the front-runner to lease more Sitt-owned land on Stillwell Avenue. 
He said he wants to expand his freak show and also use the additional space for a circus and the return of go-cart tracks to the underused site.
Strong claimed that he currently is the highest bidder for the site – even higher than Zamperla USA, which is expected to be tapped by the city to operate a six- acre amusement park in Coney Island on land that includes the old Astroland site.
But Strong doesn't boast the only show in town. He's up against the popular Coney Island USA Circus Sideshow, headed by Dick Zigun, the so-called Mayor of Coney Island.</body></row>

<body>Want to see &quot;Last Summer at Coney Island&quot; get made?You can help.The director, JL Aronson, is seeking donations to help his film, which documents the famous playground at a time when it's future is unclear.Says the director: &quot;Beginning in early Spring of 2007, I set out to capture Coney Island at a pivotal moment in its 125+ year history as an amusement destination. With City Hall and private developers laying out their competing plans for Coney Island's 21st century makeover, many of the local residents and business people felt trapped in the middle or left out in the surf. Much has happened since then, and while the area's uncertain future brought media attention from across the world, few stuck around long enough to get the full story.&quot;Currently Aronson's story is in the editing stages, and he and his team are looking to raise at least $16,000 by March 10 to finish the film and get it to festivals.You can help get them there by pledging support here, where you can also get a preview of the project, truly a labor of love.</body></row>

<body>A Coney Island grandmother is facing criminal charges after an 11-year-old autistic boy who was left home alone perished in a fire yesterday. Investigators believe Melinda McLain was at the store when Tavon Turpin began playing with matches or a lighter in a closet of their 15th-floor apartment and set the fire that took his life.

McLain was treated for smoke inhalation and charged with reckless endangerment and endangering the welfare of a child, according to the Post. Firefighters responded to the blaze just after noon and found the child unconscious inside the residence, the Times reports. Witness Anthony Artist said firefighters tried to save the boy. &quot;They were pumping his chest,&quot; Artist said. &quot;They had an oxygen tank on him and they were trying to revive him. He was covered from head to toe in soot ... It hurts. I used to put him on the school bus. Everybody loved him. He was like everybody's kid.&quot;

According to Donna Clarke, who would see the 11-year-old when she visited relatives, the boy appeared happy and well cared for. However she couldn't fathom leaving him home alone. &quot;You never leave your child alone at 11 years old, especially if he's autistic,&quot; she said. &quot;He can't help himself.&quot;</body></row>

<body>Yesterday Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz and officials unveiled plans for a new amusement park in Coney Island scheduled to open by Memorial Day.Central Amusement International will lease three City-owned parcels (6.2 acres) for ten years and invest nearly $30 million to build and operate the parks, with rides from Italy-based ride designer and manufacturer, Zamperla.McBrooklyn received a statement Tuesday from activist group Save Coney Island that praised Zamperla USA for its &quot;exciting vision.&quot;“We congratulate the City for bringing this world-class amusement operator to Coney Island,” said Save Coney Island spokesman Juan Rivero.  “We hope the City will build on this success by purchasing additional land to create space for more amusement operators to participate in Coney Island's rebirth.” This summer, CAI will open “Luna Park at Coney Island,” which will feature 19 rides, and by summer 2011, the “Scream Zone at Coney Island” will provide additional attractions, including two custom roller coasters, a human slingshot ride, and go-karts.“This is a fantastic first step” Rivero said. “We hope that this exciting vision will challenge the City and everyone to dream bigger dreams of a larger and even more spectacular Coney Island amusement district.”Photo 1, rendering of Luna Park entrance supplied by NYCEDC.

<body>Inspiration was aplenty for the Monsignor Farrell hockey team Friday night at Abe Stark Rink on Coney Island. 
It could be found in a robust partisan crowd in the stands above and in the message from the seniors from last year’s championship team in the dressing room before the game. 
“It was the best feeling you could ever get,” Farrell co-captain Joe DiTomasso said. “A crowd that big in a game this big, there’s nothing better.”
The Lions road that emotion to three first-period goals en route to a 5-2 win against Iona Prep in Game 3 of the CHSHL Class A semifinal series. 
Second-seeded Farrell (14-4-1) will get a chance to defend its title, beginning with Game 1 of the best-of-three championship series against No. 1 St. Anthony’s Saturday at the Ice Hutch in Mount Vernon. The Friars swept Fordham Prep in the other semifinal series. 
“They definitely have a longer rest time than we did,” Farrell forward Eric Reiman said. “But I say we’ll just come to play, feeding off the last two games and give them hell and see who comes out on top.”
Reiman scored the all-important opening goal at 5:58 of the first period. Less than a minute later, co-captain Joe Gambardella made it 2-0 on a wraparound and DiTomasso added a backhand with 5:02 left in the first period. Three goals on five shots and reeling Iona Prep called a timeout. 
“In the first period you always have to come out hard,” DiTomasso said. “You get one goal, it motivates you for two, motivates you for three, motivates you for four.”
Thomas Nolan scored for third-seeded Iona Prep (10-8-1), which won the opening game, 7-3, just 31 seconds into the second period. But Gambardella responded with his second with 2:32 left in the second period and Farrell had a commanding 4-1 lead heading into the final 15 minutes. 
James Corey made it 5-1 at 4:09 of the third and Iona Prep’s Michael Cambria closed out the scoring with a power play goal midway through the third. 
“Before the game Coach came in and said you guys are the champions and you’re the team to beat,” Gambardella said. “We knew what we had to do. … For the seniors, we just want to get them another ring.”
The Lions are hoping the momentum they took with them from a dominant performance in Game 2 will now carry onto the first game of the championship series. 
“I think we’re going to come out with the intensity we came out with tonight,” Gambardella said. 
And while the Lions screamed and sang the soccer anthem “Ole, ole, ole, ole” in the dressing room after the emotional Game 3 win, the party ended when they reached the parking lot. 
“Obviously we can’t go out tonight,” DiTomasso said. “We can’t be celebrating the victory. We have to get our rest and see what happens tomorrow.”

<body>????About a month after Coney Island buffs called attention to the significance of this 19th century building, the city began demolishing it this week. The small structure sits on property that used to be Astroland Park, but long before that it was the kitchen for Charles Feltman's popular restaurant. Feltman (1841-1910), a German butcher who's credited with the idea of selling pork sausages on a warm bun, popularized the hot dog, and one of his employees was none other than Nathan Handwerker, who slept on the kitchen floor before going onto start Nathan's Famous! But all we are is crumbs in the wind, and the city is tearing it down as part of a major redo of the amusement district. Also lost to the wrecking ball is this mural, painted on one wall by artist Rita Ackermann in 2004. [Via Curbed/Coney Island Message Board]</body></row>

<body>Seth Pinsky and Coney Island

As New York City development has struggled through the downturn, the city and the New York City Economic Development Corporation have had to contend with negative public sentiment, Seth Pinsky, president of the city-controlled non-profit promoting economic growth, said. “Because you don’t see physical activity on the ground, people assume [that some projects] are stalled, [that] they’re not happening,” Pinsky told a packed crowd at a Bisnow panel discussion on public and private development partnerships today. “There are two misconceptions,” about the city’s development initiatives, Pinsky added: “one is that we haven’t had success with big projects and two, that we’ve only been focused on big projects.” Although the project has been stymied along the way, Pinsky said that Coney Island's rebirth ranks as one of the Bloomberg administration’s greatest accomplishments.</body></row>

<body>New York based singer/songwriter Ian Axel rings in 2010 with his first full length album, This Is The New Year. Released January 5, the 13-track collection is a follow up to Axel’s critically-acclaimed debut EP I’m On To You. 
Music supervisors have fallen in love with Ian's songs, placing his music in episodes of MTV’s “The Real World” (Brooklyn, Hollywood, and DC), “The Hills,” and ABC's “Private Practice.”  In 2009, Apple included his songs &quot;Afterglow&quot; and &quot;We Are&quot; on the playlists of over 250 Apple Stores worldwide and invited him to perform at over 20 retail stores around the country!
This is the New Year was recorded in Spring of 2009 by Dan Romer, who has also helmed sessions with indie-poppers Ingrid Michaelson and Jenny Owen Youngs.  Through tight and melodic songcraft, Ian captures the wonder of our earlier years.  He says, &quot;I always feel like I'm trying to reconnect with something I had when I was a kid.  Children have a glow and an energy we seem to lose later.&quot;
An album of beginnings, This is the New Year taps into that innocence. With Ian Axel in your headphones, it is almost impossible not to feel some part of you beaming, embracing the open future that stretches ahead.  Your fresh decade starts now, and this is its soundtrack.</body></row>

<body>Name: Melissa Febos            
 Age: 29
 Neighborhood: Bushwick
 Occupation: Writer. Writing teacher. Her memoir, Whip Smart , about her four-year tenure as a dominatrix in NYC, is out next week on St. Martin's Press. You can catch her reading from it Wednesday, March 3 at the  Happy Ending Music and Reading Series at  Joe's Pub.

 Who's your favorite New Yorker, living or dead, real or fictional? 
My tiny Abuelita (11/12/32–8/13/07), who was born in Manhattan and raised in the Bronx. She taught me to stuff my cash in my shoe or my bra, and how to ride the subway.
 
 What's the best meal you've eaten in New York? 
The one I scarfed after completing the master cleanse. It was gone too fast for me to recognize what it consisted of. Hopefully, it was vegetarian, since I've been one my whole life. 		 In one sentence, what do you actually do all day in your job? 
I write stories, mostly true, and then talk about writing stories, and stories other people have written, and how to employ the correct usage of a semicolon.

 Would you live here on a $35,000 salary? 
I have done so for over a decade. It's not preferable.

 What's the last thing you saw on Broadway? 
Hair? Snoozefest.

 Do you give money to panhandlers? 
Usually not. Didn't I mention that I'd lived here for over a decade? If they make me laugh, maybe.  I give money to street dancers, and singers who pierce my heart, either with beauty or utter lack of talent.

 What's your drink? 
In total defiance of my upbringing, Diet Coke.

 How often do you prepare your own meals? 
If you can call what I do before I eat &quot;preparing a meal,&quot; then frequently. If you call what I do &quot;standing before the open refrigerator and deciding what to dip my fingers into,&quot; then infrequently.

 What's your favorite medication? 
Reading.

 What's hanging above your sofa? 
A whirling cloud of dust motes and dog hair.

 How much is too much to spend on a haircut? 
It's hard for me to justify not simply taking the kitchen shears and trimming over the trash can, which is my usual routine.  I recently got my first professional haircut in years at Johanna Fateman's salon, Seagull, which is totally worth the reasonable price, and makes a good argument for not doing it yourself. For those who indulge in such things as super-pricey professional haircuts, well, maybe $500? I don't know. It ain't plastic surgery, people. You can't change a picture by changing its frame.

 When's bedtime? 
11 p.m.? Whenever I have e-mailed myself into a state of exhaustion.

 Which do you prefer, the old Times Square or the new Times Square? 
I barely knew the old one, so it's easier to romanticize. They kind of represent two poles of nastiness: STDs and capitalism run amuck. I'll stick with Brooklyn, thanks.

 What do you think of Donald Trump? 
I think he looks like one of my old clients when I was a professional dominatrix. All of them, in fact.

 What do you hate most about living in New York? 
How much people complain about living in New York. The way it becomes increasingly difficult to imagine living anywhere else. 

 Who is your mortal enemy? 
Anyone who pushes his way onto the subway before the exiting passengers can exit.

 When's the last time you drove a car? 
I can't remember, but I'm sure I did so in a good impression of Quasimodo: brow furrowed, with my shoulders hunched around my ears, chin hovering over the steering wheel, and somehow also fiddling with the radio. I used to love driving, but New York — as well as a growing awareness of my own mortality — has handicapped me in this regard. I can't drive without compulsively imagining my own bloody dismemberment, the horrifying shriek of metal folding like an accordion.  My imagination is often my greatest enemy.

 How has the Wall Street crash affected you? 
It hasn't. That's one of the few advantages of being poor.

<body>Happy “Year of the Tiger” to the Zenfoodist family, and of course similar greetings to all of the posters on the Outerboros Forum on Chowhound.

In the event that you lack the time to make homemade “Lo Bak Gao” for the Chinese New Year’s celebration, we just wanted to advise you that the “Tai Pan” Bakery in Flushing is selling “Lo Bak Gao” cake (about 1 to 2 lbs in a red rectangular box) during the Chinese New Year’s holidays in limited quantities in two versions, one plain at $8.88 and another with dried scallops for $12.80.  Last year, we were not able to buy any of the “Lo Bak Gao” with dried scallops last year, as they were all sold out by the time we went to “Tai Pan,” but this year we went early year and were able to buy one plain and one with the dried scallops.

For a store bought “Lo Bak Gao” cake, the Tai Pan Bakery versions are not bad for those who lack the time or inclination to make “Lo Bak Gao” at home, since making the “Lo Bak Gao” cake is very labor intensive.

The taste test of both versions indicates that there is not a major difference between the plain and the one with dried scallop, whereas the dried scallop version costs 50% more, and while one can taste a subtle scallop flavor when one eats a portion of the “Lo Bak Gao” that happens to have several shredded strands of the dried scallop, our conclusion is that one can be quite happy with the plain version and save approximately $4.00, especially in these recessionary times when every dollar saved is a dollar earned if we can paraphrase Benjamin Franklin.  It would require much more dried scallops than the amount presently in the “Tai Pan” “Lo Bak Gao” cakes with dried scallops, but if the dried scallops were increased to an amount sufficient to have a significant taste, than the turnip cake would be priced out of sight when dried scallops are $35/lb and up (we have seen them at several hundred dollars per pound) depending upon size and quality.  It would probably be more accurate if the “Lo Bak Gao” were described as “flavored” with dried scallops.

Many Chinese grocers and bakeries sell “Lo Bak Gao,” but the “Tai Pan” version is quite acceptable, but as with all store bought versions, the “Lo Bak Gao” could have more turnip taste.

No store bought “Lo Bak Gao” will of course, compare favorably with the version your own mother makes or your own homemade version.


Note:  For those readers who might not be aware of what “Lo Bak Gao” cake is, it is not a sweet dessert cake in the western sense, but is translated as “Chinese Turnip Cake (Lo Bak Gao, 蘿蔔糕),” consisting of Chinese white turnip, sweet rice, and various seasonings; see photo of “Lo Bak Gao” (attached below) ready to be served with an oyster sauce dip.</body></row>

<body>(...Continued from Part 1 and Part 2)“Leather and jeans, your watch glamorous...”My final day at Mercedes Benz Fashion Week was the most chill – no shows or events until the evening meant I had the afternoon and morning free to hangout with friends in the City (whom I’m highly thankful for – as they immediately took me to Chinatown for a big bowl of noodles upon hearing about my deprivation of solid foods for the past two days)...Anyways, onto the final installment! What (show): Tony Cohen @ Salon, Bryant Park*Dutch born Tony Cohen is a NYC girl's dream man - not only is this ex-athlete uber easy on the eyes, he also produces beautifully draped garments using a predominantly black color palate. My seatmate and I could not stop gushing over Tony's intricate plays of the LBD using an eclectic blend of wools, cashmere, and silk jersey. (For) who: The New York City transplant who hasn’t quite abandoned her all-black de rigueur NYC wardrobe Wear (this to):  Painfully hip nightspots like the Foundation Lounge, Gypsy, or Umbria that serve as a reminder of nights in the Meatpacking District. Fun Fact(s): Lovely giftbags filled with assorted beauty items from Napoleon Perdis (who did the makeup for the show and who was seated in the first row) were given out on all seats. The runway also was decorated with black rose petals - which gave the show a romantically macabre Valentine's Day touch. What (show): Custo Barcelona @ Tent, Bryant Park*Lights! Camera! Action! were the three words that popped into my head as I watched Custo Barcelona's brightly flamboyant looks sashay down the runway. Under the name &quot;Hairy Metal&quot;, Custo Dalmau presented a collection of bronze, steel, gold, black, and rust mixed with graphics inspired by mercury, melted silver, red hot iron and tin. With all the hot pink furs, jewel toned tie dyed satin mini dresses with metallic accents, and sparkly suits (for men!), I had the urge to jump up and do the disco ala Saturday Night Fever style!? ? (For) who:  The jet set international playboy(girl) who embraces color and attentionWear (this to): International night (i.e. every night) at Venu or Rumor – where the disco ball is the only thing that can outshine your outfit Fun Fact(s):  Second time in a row that I was placed in the second row (pun intended!). I sat directly behind Miss USA and Miss Universe - both decked out in head to toe Custo - while the photographers were taking snaps.  So if you happened to stumble upon any said photos - look for a little Asian girl in the corner  - unless I’m (very likely) photoshopped out. What (show): Style360 / Bebe Launch Party @ SohoThe night before the Bebe x Kim Kardashian fashion show, Bebe threw a grand opening party at their new Soho store. While I was sad that Miss K was MIA (the busy bee was at Sephora launching her new fragrance. Grrr.), I managed to console myself by checking out the sexy skin hugging dresses and bling bling accesories around the shop while sipping on the free flowing champagne. Now thats a double Yum! (For) who:  The glamazon who is proud of her bodyWear (this to):  The Liberty Hotel Bar – cause when the girl to guy ratio is 10:1 – you gotta find a way to stand outFun Fact(s):  Even though the Kardashian was MIA, I still was entertained by the sounds from Little Boots (pictured above), who DJed the event. I couldn't stay long since I had to hike it uptown for the Perry Ellis show but I heard Grizz Chapman from 30 Rock &quot;rocked&quot; the event later on with his presence. What (show): Perry Ellis @ Promenade, Bryant Park...And last but certainly not least for the weekend: Perry Ellis. I was pumped to be attending another eye candy menswear show (after the pleasant experience at Simon Spurr) and Perry Ellis did not disappoint. Creative Director John Crocco sent out classic sweaters, coats, and pleated pants perfect for a day at the office along with more avant garde pieces (i.e. the crocodile embossed waist coat, red velvet scarves). The standout piece would have to be the lush velvet blazer with a pocket square detail (right) because lets face it, boys...</body></row>

<body>Sign of the times…      That isn’t exactly the listing but it might as well be: The US Airways Airbus 320 that Capt. Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger landed in the Hudson River a year ago is for sale. The insurance company that took possession of it after paying off the policy is looking to unload it.    The auction — “As Is/Where Is (New Jersey),” Chartis Insurance Group is compelled to disclose — does not include the airliner’s engines or avionics, and the lot is somewhat in pieces. But apart from that it seems to be surprisingly intact for a craft that hit the water at a normal touchdown speed with ad hoc landing gear comprising the entire fuselage and wings — which, by the way supported all 155 people aboard as they safely deplaned and awaited rescue craft on the frigid Hudson.

A Year After a Splashdown, Returning to the Hudson

Michael Appleton for The New York TimesUS Airways Flight 1549 crash-landed in the Hudson River on Jan. 15, 2009, one year ago this Friday.

<body>Everyone celebrates anniversaries differently, some choosing to focus on nostalgia while others use the occasion to celebrate the future. The Upper Crust, an event space located along the Hudson River at 91 Horatio Street, managed to find the perfect blend of the two when they celebrated their 25th Anniversary earlier this month. First, a little background: The Upper Crust originally made their name as a go-to for corporate events, but the tragic events of September 11th and the financial meltdown that followed required the minds behind the space to get creative in order to stay open. So, they turned to weddings. They found their flexible space and fresh approach to nuptials to be greatly appreciated by couples, and soon, weddings were no longer the fall back, but an entirely new division that the business embraced with welcoming arms. The anniversary celebration featured food, drinks and music, provided by the same staff and vendors that founder Dan Fehlig works with often. The evening was capped by a short film entitled 19 Love Stories, which spotlighted 19 couples who had tied the knot at the space. Each story was sweet and original, moving the viewers between laughter and tears at times (many of the couples featured were in attendance), but beyond what the interviews contained, the sheer fact that 38 people all agreed to sit down and be interviewed regarding their wedding venue spoke enough for The Upper Crust. The personal attention paid to the weddings came through not only in the stories of the couples, but also through each small detail seen at this particular event. A small photo of each couple greeted guests as they walked in, with mini bouquets awaiting the brides, replicated from the ones they carried down the aisle. The menu, crafted by resident chef Abe de la Houssaye, contained 19 items, all inspired by love, accompanied by stories of the various ingredients (including references to mythology, antidotes and purported aphrodisiacs). If this creative and beautiful evening of celebration was even a partial representation of the type of events The Upper Crust is capable of planning, then engaged couples (or those looking to get engaged) would definitely be remiss in not taking the opportunity to at least have a chat with Dan and crew.

So is Goldman Sachs.That's the only possible conclusion from the news that broke yesterday that Goldman had pulled out of its partnership to develop the Hudson Yards on the West Side into a residential and commercial neighborhood to rival any in the city. Its partner Related is putting a brave face on the loss of the deepest pockets around and downplaying its decision to delay signing a contract to take over the site from the M.T.A., for two months. Only time will tell if they really plan to go ahead.Maybe Goldman read the same recent economic reports that I have….[Continue reading at Greg David on New York.]</body></row>

<body>505 W 37th is a nice addition to the new development wave happening in Midtown West/Clinton. A brand new pair of glass towers on West 37th Street, this rental complex is the sister building to 455 West 37th Street. The second installment of the Hudson Yards rental complex now has Studios, 1, &amp; 2 bedroom units available for rent. Located in the up-and-coming Clinton area on the west side, many units offer breath taking city &amp; river views through floor-to-ceiling windows. Many units even have private balconies or terraces, and high ceilings rarely found in new construction. The pass-through kitchens have granite countertops and stainless steel appliances.

Welcome to the first day of February. While you listen and react to the first episode of Rowbot Radio, here are some links to read and discuss as well.
Renck: This year the year the Rockies show fans they aren't a fluke - The Denver PostIt's become a truism outside of Colorado that the Rockies can only make the playoffs as a Cinderella story or with, as Troy Renck puts it in his latest piece, &quot;a half-court shot.&quot; But after 2010, baseball's going to need to forget about such simple answers for the Rockies:
&quot;When people think of the Rockies, I want them to think of a winning organization,&quot; shortstop Troy Tulowitzki said the other day.
That's why this year is so important. If the Rockies reach the playoffs this fall ? and I believe they will, winning 89 games ? they become unmistakably relevant. Two Disney playoff runs in three seasons, perhaps, can be dismissed. Three postseason berths in four years cannot, regardless of the path.

As prettyinpurple remarked, &quot;This is R year!&quot;
Official farewell for O's Mora - baltimoresun.com
&quot;They are going to have a great team, and I know it is hard in the division, but they just have to do all the routine plays. I think they are going to be close,&quot; Mora said. &quot;When the Orioles are good, I will feel good. But this is my decision. It is time to move on and to go somewhere else and explore out there.
&quot;And we chose Colorado and a tremendous organization.&quot;

<body>See this story at BrooklynPaper.com.By Gersh KuntzmanThe Brooklyn PaperIf you were in love with two people at the same time and could not pick between them, you might feel at times that you had lost your way.

But if that struggle took place just as the notorious Abu Ghraib photos were leaked to the media, you might feel that you were not the only one who was lost, but that your entire nation had become untethered, that one of the bedrock ideals in your crazy, messed-up life — the notion of a just and honest America — had crumbled.

And then you’d know a tiny bit of what Cobble Hill poet and memoirist Nick Flynn (“Another Bullshit Night in Suck City”) felt as he was writing his latest book, “The Ticking is the Bomb” (Norton).

The good news is that the destruction of personal and national ideals makes for a scintillating memoir that proves uncategorically that the personal is indeed political.

The book obstensibly concerns itself with how Flynn picked one of the two women, gave up booze and drugs, and found peace as a new father, but it is far more ambitious than a mere account of how one screwed up 50-year-old found his way during one of America’s darkest periods.

Taking readers from Mount Calvary to the Mai Lai massacre site to every grusome moment before and after, Flynn makes an effective case that our entire civilization is resting on a foundation of brutality.

But after Abu Ghraib, it was all different.

“The transformative moment in any era is when people suddenly accept what has been previously unaccepitable,” Flynn told The Brooklyn Paper. “In ‘Another Bullshit Night,’ that moment was when people accepted masses of homeless people living on the street. Just 10 years earlier, people would have said, ‘Oh, that’s not America. That’s not who we are.’ But one day we woke up and were OK with it.

“The same thing happened with torture,” he added.

Seeing the Abu Ghraib photos deeply affected Flynn — in the same way that a man is constantly called “paranoid” only to discover that everyone is indeed out to get him.

The year after the photos were leaked to the media, for example, Flynn won an award from PEN, the literary and humanitarian group. The night’s other honoree? Sam Harris, whose non-fiction book, “The End of Faith,” actually advocates the use of torture in some circumstances.

“Harris is free to write and publish whatever he wishes, but why did a human rights organizataion choose to endorse it with an award?” Flynn writes. “And why had they photographed me shaking hands with him, smiling like an idiot?”

That photograph, along with the ones from Abu Ghraib, torments Flynn. A human rights organization. A president. A nation. Did anyone in this country care that we torture human beings?

“I thought the Abu Ghraib photos would be a moment of awakening, but they were not,” he said. “We accept it. It’s no longer a shameful secret. Think back to the Reagan years. We did some especially dark things in El Salvador and Nicaragua, but the difference was that Reagan denied it to the end. But Bush said openly that we’ve tortured in the past and we will again.

“I guess it’s refreshingly honest, but when we accept it, we’ve crossed over.”

But “The Ticking is the Bomb” is not an indictment of any former president or even the soldiers on that infamous night shift. In Flynn’s book, we have met the enemy and it is us.

“There are many important books that came out about Abu Ghraib, but they were all from a journalistic perspective — trying to understand these strange people who did these horrible things at Abu Ghraib,” Flynn said. “But those soldiers are not monsters — that’s too easy. We’ve been doing it for years. This is who we are. We need a reckoning among ourselves, not just putting [notorious leash-holder] Lynndie England in jail.”

Is America capable of that?

“Our main problem is American exceptionalism itself,” he said. “We believe that we are the best country in the world — and as soon as you start thinking that, you are asking for trouble.”

It’s not just foreign policy. ...</body></row>

<body>This is a guest post from Kaare Revill who has traveled extensively with her three kids: ages 6, 4, and 2.  She was kind enough to share her best recommendations for a family visit to Estonia - a family-friendly European destination that most Americans don't know much about.  She blogs at Abrilliantplace

      Location of Estonia
    
  
  


Estonia is a small and beautifully forested country in Europe.  Some people have never heard of it, and even if they have, most are pretty fuzzy on its geographical location.  Its shores are washed by the Gulf of Finland and the Baltic Sea; it is bordered on the east by Russia and on the south by another small Baltic country called Latvia.  It's had a long history of foreign rule and a short, but successful history of independence.  As a traveling American-Canadian family, many people have been bewildered as to why one would choose to go to Estonia.  Let me say straight out that after having visited nearly every country in Europe, I think Estonia is one of the most child-friendly.  With a multitude of outdoor and indoor playgrounds and activities, museums, historical monuments, unique shops and restaurants and natural beauty, we found plenty to keep us (a family of five, with three kids under 6) happy.

There are several cities in Estonia.  While Tartu and Parnu have their own unique charm, Tallinn, especially Old Town Tallinn, holds a special place in my heart.  There was nothing more magical for me than entering the thick stone 13th century walls, overseen by a multitude of towers and steeples, to meander down distinctive cobblestone streets with three small children in tow.  We spent time in Tallinn in both the deep of winter and the long hours of sun in early summer.  While Christmas-time certainly has great atmosphere and fun activities.  If your goal is to spend time outdoors and see everything, then spring, summer or early fall is the time to go.


That said, I have so many favorite things that I'll break Old Town into kid-friendly routes to make it more realistic for little legs, and a parent's patience.  While it's possible to take a large-wheeled stroller into Old Town (some restaurants and other buildings have stroller ramps), the sidewalk curbs and bumpy cobblestone streets make this something I wouldn't recommend.





  

  




Tallinn Estonia Sites in Old Town - West

Toompark - with lots of paths and a long narrow lake, this is a beautiful place to run wild, see occassional art displays and feed the birds.


Patkuli and Kohuotsa View Platforms - very touristy spots, but with lovely views of the city; perfect for those family pics.


Nuku Teater - the children's theater, which produces beautiful and professional puppet shows for children (there are plays and productions for adults as well).  With a bathroom, cafe and free coat check, this is a place you could go see and show and end up spending an entire half day by itself.  Next door is a shop that sells classic Estonian Kalev chocolates.  Prices for kids are 90 EEKs and 25 EEKs for adults, and shows are less than an hour.  Tickets can be purchased in advance from www.piletilevi.ee


Lodusmuuseum - If you're up for a bit of an educational adventure, this small, but packed museum Museum of Natural History covers everything from rocks and fossils to a diverse collection of stuffed animals and insects.


Le Bonaparte - Small restaurant/cafe with yummy quiche and croissant selection during the day.  Note: leave strollers outside, hold kids’ hands to go up three or four very big steep steps.  Opens at noon.


Suurtuki Playground - sandy and cement areas that have play sets for a varying range of ages and even exercise equipment (that the kids also like to play on) geared towards parents.

<body>Roosevelt Island Gristedes Image From Roosevelt Island 360Gristedes is the only supermarket on Roosevelt Island. It has been the subject of contstant complaints by residents over a long period of time including outdated grocery items on the shelf, exorbitant prices, dirty aisles and pigeons walking around the store among others. Readers of this 2007 post asking whether the increased competition from the new Roosevelt Island Duane Reade would improve the quality of service at Gristedes commented:Gristedes has always been a major disappointment long before I moved to Roosevelt Island. Their stores are by far the most disgusting, confusing and over priced grocery stores in NYC.The only time I set foot into our Gristedes is when I really need something that I don't have at home or ran out of.Does Gristede's deliberately try to stock the worst possible produce that it can get? There's a reason why Fresh Direct chose Roosevelt Island as its pilot. If that store didn't get a fantastic break on the rent, it would have been out of business long ago.Fast forward to as recently as last week and the complaints continue. For example, a newly arrived Roosevelt Island resident reports: ...We use Fresh Direct, too, which is amazing, but it's just a drag when you just need to buy milk or orange juice at Gristedes and have to worry that it's been left out of refrigeration too long and spoiled. Definitely bought things there before that had gone bad and needed to be thrown away. Here's hoping it gets better!...Well, things may be changing at the Roosevelt Island Gristedes.RIOC President Steve Shane reported in his 1/11/10 Message (Item 10):Gristedes: We met on site with John Catsimatidis, the owner, and his staff to discuss operations of the store. Gristedes has a new buying arrangement with Shoprite, both allegedly improving quality and reducing shelf price. We discussed a marketing plan by web site or otherwise as there is no easy medium for communicating to the specific buying public on the Island. Does everyone know that seniors get a 10% discount on Tuesdays? Revitalizing Gristedes would be good for everyone.Followed by Mr. Shane's 1/25 Message (Item 8): Gristedes: We met on site with John Catsimatidis, the owner, and his staff to discuss operations of the store. An open letter to Island residents is published in this edition of the WIRE. If they come through with their promises, should be a benefit for everyone.And during an exchange of email messages between  Gristedes representative Walter D'Agostino and myself, Mr. D'Agostino sends the following message to Roosevelt Island community: Gristedes is very proud to have served and to continue to serve the residents of and visitors to Roosevelt Island for over 20 years.Gristedes takes its' role in the lives of the Roosevelt Island residents very seriously and makes every effort to ensure them successful shopping experience.If for any reason Gristedes does not live up to its' responsibility I would welcome the opportunity to take actions to correct the situation.I am in the store on a regular basis or if it is more convenient please feel free to contact me via e-mail (wdagostino@gristedes.com) or on my cell.(917 567 8237)and:1. Gristedes has partnered with ShopRite and will be increasing the quantity and variety of ShopRite items carried in the store.2. Gristedes offers free delivery to Island residents.$3. Gristedes offers two Senior Discount days, Tuesday and Wednesday. 10% discount to all Seniors.4. Gristedes has expanded the Organic and Natural offering in all departments.5. Gristedes has upgraded prepared foods and Grab 'n Go. 6. Gristedes accepts phone orders 212-371-2680.7. Gristedes is open everyday from 7 AM to Midnight8. Every item in the store is being removed from the shelves and checked for quality and proper dates. This will be accomplished by the end of February. Let's see what happens and hope that the Roosevelt Island Gristedes does improve. After all, they did install a $1 a night Blockbuster DVD rental kiosk.On another Roosevelt Island Gristedes topic, a reader of t...</body></row>

<body>Eli Manning won't be the only person with connections to both the Giants and Sunday's Super Bowl. The CBS pregame show will also feature a jailhouse interview with Plaxico Burress. We'd tell you exactly when to tune in, but with the show starting sometime on Friday night we'd be lost as to figure out exactly when they'll turn attention to the poster child for gun control.Thankfully, the New York Post has some details from his sitdown with his former Steelers coach Bill Cowher. Burress says he hand-wrote letters of apology to Giants owners John Mara and Steve Tisch and vowed to make a triumphant return to the NFL. He's not letting incarceration keep him from preparing for the big day, however. He's working out four days a week, although his workouts are a bit limited by his surroundings.&quot;It?s not LA Fitness or Bally?s, but I do push-ups, sit-ups,&quot; Burress said. &quot;I make do.&quot;Nothing too surprising or earth-shattering there as you probably assumed that Plax would like a shot to continue his football career when his prison term comes to an end. What is of some interest is the fact that Cowher conducted the interview and said afterward that he believes Burress deserves a chance to resume his career.We've already heard the chatter linking Cowher to the Giants job should it open up after next season. Cowher's denied Jerome Bettis's assertion that he's waiting around for the job to open, but that isn't the same thing as denying interest in a chance to coach the Giants and he's been pretty open about being willing to consider a return to the sideline in the future.Just spitballing, but let's say Cowher does wind up replacing Tom Coughlin and Burress gets out of jail and has a hard time finding someone willing to give him an opportunity. Could there be a possible second go-round for Burress in Big Blue? The gut feeling is that it would be too big a PR nightmare for the Giants to enter into of their own volition, but sports can make for strange bedfellows sometimes.  Okay, maybe it's not of that much interest. It's a decent way to while away a few minutes on an obscenely slow sports news day, though.Josh Alper is a writer living in New York City and is a contributor to FanHouse.com and ProFootballTalk.com in addition to his duties for NBCNewYork.com.</body></row>

In a jailhouse interview, former Giants star Plaxico Burress vowed to &quot;play again,&quot; and said he still works out about four days a week even though prison is &quot;not like LA Fitness or Bally's.&quot; He added: &quot;I do push-ups, sit-ups...I made do.&quot;

In his first interview since being sentenced to two years in prison for attempted gun possession after shooting himself in the leg with an unlicensed pistol in a Manhattan nightclub, the wide receiver told CBS' &quot;NFL Today&quot; that he &quot;personally hand-wrote a letter&quot; to Giants owners John Mara and Steve Tisch to apologize for the 2008 incident. &quot;I told them how sorry I was about bringing all this bad publicity to such a stand-up organization,&quot; he said, according to the Post. 

Last month, prison officials rejected Burress' bid to take part in a work-release program that would have let him out of prison for a specified amount of time each week. Burress is eligible to reapply in July. If he is rejected again, he'll be released in July 2011, according to the tabloid. The Q and A—conducted by Bill Cowher, Burress' former coach when he played for the Pittsburgh Steelers—will air before the Superbowl on Sunday.</body></row>

<body>News of the planned renovation of the Loew's (pronounced LOWees in this part of the world) Kings Theater on Flatbush Avenue sent us scurrying to our files for Loew's ephemera. And, given the sad history of the theater over the past thirty years, it caused us to think a little about the tenuous nature of plans, and their tendency to turn into something other than reality. One could be forgiven for greeting the announcement of a planned $70 million cash infusion with more than a little scepticism--after all, we heard it all before, and more than once.?
After the Kings went dark, the Amsterdam News on July 1, 1978 reported that Community Development funds would be funneled into the acquisition and renovation of the theatre,? &quot;to provide cultural facilities and attract private investors for commercial development.&quot;??But by 1980 that plan was scuttled. A scaled-down?version put forward in 1981 also bit the dust. Theatre lovers and preservationists never gave up, but it seems they had a hard row to plow.? Between 1987 and 1992??funds from ?Brooklyn Borough President Howard Golden? allowed for a roof renovation, but according to the New York Times, the estimate for complete restoration of the theater in 1996? was about $10 million.

In 1992 New York Newsday reported that &quot;several community groups and Nakash Brothers Realty are working together to restore the Loew's Kings to its former glory.&quot; Plans mooted at this time included? &quot;a 3,200 seat theater, a 500-seat restaurant, a catering hall, a health spa, a hotel with convention facilities, and the first wax museum exclusively featuring international black leaders.&quot;? Once more the ideas all came to nought. Enter stage left Magic Johnson in 1998, when hopes were raised that? the star point guard?would infuse new life into the dormant?husk, but once again the movie palace only fell into deeper disrepair.
A recent New York Times article asserts confidently that this time, &quot;...it's for real. A developer has signed an agreement, made a down payment on a $70 million renovation and plans to turn the building back into a functioning entertainment site.&quot;
?

So in celebration of what appears to be a sure thing, here are three scans from the Loew's Kings Inaugural program.? On Saturday September 7th, 1929, the evening began with the Star Spangled Banner. There followed a &quot;Divertissement Musicale&quot; played by the Loew's Kings orchestra; a Dedication trailer and a Movietone greeting by MGM stars; an organ solo feature; a stage presentation called &quot;Frills and Fancies&quot;; and then Wesley Eddie and his Kings of Syncopation with the real Dolores Del Rio, in person, and the Chester Hale Girls.? The feature presentation was the United Artists picture, &quot;Evangeline,&quot; starring that same Dolores Del Rio, this time the illusory version, in celluloid.

<body>What if you were fortunate enough to own a keepsake that had belonged to MAE WEST?  Would you sell it?  Could you prove it legitimately did come from Mae's household?  Listen in.  • • • •  QUESTION:  I have an unusual, 2-foot-tall ashtray in excellent shape that once belonged to actress Mae West. I got it at an auction in the 1970s for $350. I am retiring soon and want to sell it, but I have no idea of its current value. Can you help me?  — — T.B., San Jose• •  • •  ANSWER by Steven Wayne Yvaska• •  The saucy Mae West (1893—1980), remembered for her quips, once said, &quot;He who hesitates is last.&quot; [sic]  In this case, it was smart of you to wait and ask for advice before selling off your unusual treasure.• • I shared photos of your Art Deco-style ashtray — — stainless steel with two black spheres — — with appraiser Stephen G. Turner, a decorative arts and fine arts consultant for Bonhams &amp; Butterfields, the notable San Francisco auction gallery.• • He brought up a key point that helps establish the value of objects such as yours: the provenance, or history of ownership.• • &quot;Anything that can be proven to have been owned and used by a 'celebrity,' whether an actress or the president of the United States, exceeds its lowest common denominator,&quot; Turner said.• • He told me Mae West's estate was sold in Los Angeles in 2000 by what was then called Butterfields.• • If you obtained your ashtray at this show, a sales catalog and, perhaps, the sales receipt would be sufficient proof showing the item was owned by the fabled star.• • If you cannot prove provenance, your ashtray is nothing more than an interesting artifact. And it may not even be worth what you paid.• • If, however, you can identify the item as one that belonged to West, Turner says it could be worth from $800 to $1,200.  ...    — — Excerpt: — —• • Article: Seasoned collector: What's it worth?

<body>A Baltimore rabbi could be turning a false profit. 
  Menachem Youlus drew fame in the last decade for unearthing supposed Holocaust-era Torahs hidden in mass graves, monasteries and concentration camps throughout Europe, but many of those discoveries appear to be fakes, according to a new report. 
  Spinning sensational yarns of his hunts for sacred scrolls, the 48-year-old rabbi earned the moniker &quot;The Indiana Jones of Torah Scribes&quot; and sold the texts to US synagogues and Jewish families for $6,000 to $15,000. 
  One of the 1,100 recovered Torahs was bought by billionaire investor David Rubenstein and donated in 2008 to Manhattan's Central Synagogue. 
  But The Washington Post poked holes in stories behind the Torahs' origins, raising doubts about their authenticity. 
  Youlus sold a Virginia synagogue a Torah he claimed to have found in the floorboards of Bergen-Belsen, a German concentration camp. But the camp's historian told the newspaper that no such discovery occurred. 
  Central Synagogue's Torah also has a dubious provenance. Youlus claimed he secretly unearthed it in 2004 in a cemetery near Auschwitz, the Polish concentration camp. 
  Youlus, however, could not provide the newspaper with a single name or document to back up the tale.

<body>Following the paper trail of Papel ...There's a new shop in town and I couldn't be happier :) Papel (Spanish for paper) is a Brooklyn based paperie filled with some of my favorite card and stationery designers. The space is perfection and the owner, Raegan Hirvela is natural and friendly. I stumbled upon Papel yesterday walking down Court Street. To me it was like walking into a candy shop! This is Raegan above. When I handed her my card, she recognized it from Fat Cat (yes, my exhibit is still up, thanks for wondering ;) It turns out she lives in (owners) Miki &amp; Daniel's building a block down from me. It's such a small world! I had the chance to sit down and ask all about her start. Her hometown is Queens and although she's always been crafty, she is not a designer herself. She's lived on the West Coast as well, but hard for any self respecting city girl to stay away from NYC too long ;) After spending years working predominantly in fashion and corporate retail, when her wedding approached, she decided to design her own invitations, place settings and all correspondence. Her designs were a Big Hit and the responses overwhelming! I have to think that all that positive feedback contributed to the confidence it takes to follow a new path.* Above some colorful calendars and recipe cards by Dabney Lee, local designer in Dumbo.Realizing she'd like to run her own business, Raegan began researching two years ago and incorporated herself while still working full time. She began contemplating ideas and researching the neighborhood, while attending classes &amp; seminars in her spare time. On a ski trip in Vermont, it was her husband Jeff who asked, how about paper products? It was that simple. As serendipity would have it, she soon partnered with her instructor of a free entrepreneurial class offered by the city. She was off and running! 1st stop, the business plan.*I am a big fan of Andy Pratt Designs, especially the vibrant city scenes on his cards, notebooks &amp; journals. I was charmed by his Silvercup letterpress below, since I often work on those stages.Again, timing seemed to work to her advantage. Raegan found out that her full time position would be coming to an end in May '09. Fortunately, she and Jeff had been saving up for a year in anticipation of their new venture and in August she began purchasing her stock of stationery and cards. By the end of September she found her storefront (within walking distance from home) signed the lease and opened her doors December 11th, 2009 :DMy favorite story is how she branded her store. Her friend, Soosan Joon whose artwork is on display (paintings above) teaches at The Art Institute and asked if her students could brand her company free of charge. 20 talented design students competed and it was narrowed down to 3 teams. Her choice in the end was the little paper plane. The logo is simple and communicates her concept in a light and playful way :) It definitely caught my eye walking along Court Street.It's an inspiring story because she mixed passion with practicality and took the time to decide what interested her most and what would work well in this part of the  neighborhood. When the time came, she took the plunge!There are no other stores like it around, specializing in high-end, eco-friendly stationery, customizable invitations and extraordinary papers. *Charming hedgehog notebook by Girl of All Work Accessories, they also designed the fabulous page flags and piggy post-its above :)*Wrapping papers by Seltzer Goods, Waste Not Paper &amp; Snow and Graham who also sell their lines of cards here.*Honey Bee Calendar above by Hammerpress Love their style!*Canisters with cute growth charts by Rag and Bone Bindery :D*Adorable vintage inspired cards by Writeables, not sure if their images are vintage or inspired by the style. If you know, I'm curious. They're all super sweet. Above is a binder full of samples for custom invitations. She currently works with about 8 specialty vendors including Dabney Lee (located in nearby Dumbo), Wiley Valentine and Dauphine Press. The books I saw would make...</body></row>

<body>Josh Ozerksy is now a Time columnist and a “Master Hamburger Seminar” teacher, but his most entertaining gig continues to be as host of the Mr. Cutlets radio show. Yesterday, Sebastiaan Zijp (who took over Bar Blanc from Cesar Ramirez) discussed his time in the kitchens of David Bouley and Paul Liebrandt, neither of whom sound like anyone’s dream boss. Regarding Bouley: “He has his way and everyone else has to catch up to him.” For example: “Finding out at 5 p.m. on a Friday night that there’s a private party you have to go to and he takes everybody’s mise en place for your Friday night and you have to run around and do everything all over again and you got 120 people coming in half an hour.” Like Zijp says, these things happen, but Liebrandt sounds like a different story altogether.  		“Paul taught me boldness and arrogance,” Zijp says. He goes on later: “He’s very, very talented — he knows what he’s doing. He’s got a very good style and very good sense and but also very … I guess probably the closest to working for somebody if I was to work in Europe in the sense that you’re the cook; you’re the grunt; you work, and you don’t laugh, you don’t talk, you don’t own anything … it’s like you’re almost in the army; it’s very different than here in New York and he’s still very structured in that sense … In my first week I laughed at one of his jokes and he said, ‘You don’t know me well enough to laugh at one of my jokes.’” Ouch.

<body>The financially troubled owners of two massive apartment complexes that sold for a record $5.4 billion a few years ago said Monday they're turning them over to their creditors. 

The joint venture ownership team led by Tishman Speyer Properties and BlackRock Realty, hurt by the real estate market collapse, couldn't make a multimillion-dollar loan payment earlier this month for the Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village apartments in Manhattan. 

Over the last few days it became clear the only viable alternative to bankruptcy would be to transfer to lenders control and operation of the 110 buildings and 11,000 apartments overlooking the East River, partnership spokesman Bud Perrone said. 

&quot;We make this decision as we feel a battle over the property or a contested bankruptcy proceeding is not in the long-term interest of the property, its residents, our partnership or the city,&quot; Perrone said in an e-mailed statement. 

The group bought the complexes, which have about 25,000 tenants, in 2006 at the height of the real estate bubble in the nation's largest residential real estate deal. 

The record purchase price seemed outrageous to many real estate analysts, but the partnership believed it had a winning strategy: It would aggressively convert thousands of rent-regulated apartments occupied by middle-class families into luxury units that would fetch top dollar. 

But the tactic was a bust as the city's housing market cooled considerably. 

Ratings firms estimated the value of the 80-acre area had fallen to as little as $2 billion -- far less than the outstanding loan balance. 

Apartment conversions happened much slower than expected, tenants fought back and a state court ruled that about $200 million in the partnership's new rent increases was improper. 

A state court ruled that the company improperly raised the rent for thousands. 

It was a major victory for tenants and potentially thousands of other New York City renters.

The court ruled the owners of the complex harmed rent-stabilized tenants by forcing some of them out of their apartment; and also market-value tenants by over-charging them. The dispute centers on the &quot;J-51 tax abatement.&quot; It gives landlords a tax break to renovate apartments. 

&quot;The Court of Appeals said very clearly you cannot receive this tax break while you are pushing rent-stabilized tenants out the door at the same time. That practice ends today,&quot; said City Councilman Dan Garodnick. 

The group, which used a $3 billion mortgage and a $1.4 billion secondary loan to buy the properties, had been trying to restructure its debt. It couldn't make a $16 million loan payment due Jan. 8. 

Analysts had been expecting the ownership group to default on its loan for several months. 

It hasn't been determined when the ownership transfer of the sister properties will take place and who specifically the new owners will be, Perrone said. 

Tishman Speyer, whose other properties include Rockefeller Center and the Chrysler Building, said it wouldn't consider a long-term management contract to continue operating the apartment complexes if it didn't involve ownership. 

It said it was committed to an efficient transition of the properties' operations and would manage them during that transition. 

The housing complexes, which are so big they have their own newspaper, were built by Metropolitan Life in the 1940s for returning World War II veterans. MetLife Inc. decided to sell them in 2005, when real estate prices were soaring. 

Tenants launched their own bid to take over the 11,227 units, three out of four of which were rent-stabilized and priced far below the market rate, before MetLife announced it had closed a deal with the partnership led by Tishman Speyer and BlackRock.</body></row>

Mike David is finally throwing the comedy show he wants to see, and thinks downtown Chicago needs to see.
After four years of seeing local stand-up comedy and inviting Chicago comedians to co-host on his popular and wonderfully giddy and crass Internet radio show Red Bar Radio, David, in partnership with comedian Kyle Lane, will be producing a new weekly stand-up show in downtown Chicago at the Ontourage nightclub. David says, ?I have been going to comedy shows for the last four years and have done a lot of complaining. I never thought any of the shows in Chicago were up to Chicago standards. We?re the third largest city in the country, and we don?t have a world class comedy club?there?s no reason why we can?t have comedy clubs that pay comedians.?
David also has ideas about how to present comedians as entertainment to his downtown audience: ?[We will book] three-person line-ups, ensuring that each comic gets their time on stage, to connect with an audience?give the comics a chance to make a name for themselves.?
The Red Bar Comedy Club is one of just a few rooms seeking to bring local stand-up comedy to downtown Chicago, populated at night by four-star hotel patrons, Northwestern University students, and Gold Coast condo owners*. ?The ultimate goal is to have this club become a Chicago staple for downtown. This is where you go when you visit Chicago for stand-up,? David says.
For the inaugural event, many members of David?s ?Barmy?, the legion of devoted Red Bar radio show fans throughout the United States, have committed to spending the weekend in Chicago and attending the event ? ?We have over one hundred Red Bar fans flying in to see the first show,? David said.
The Red Bar Radio podcast can be found here.
The first Red Bar Comedy Club show is TOMORROW, 8:30PM, and will feature local stand-up comics Dean Carlson, James Fritz, and Sean Flannery, with host Steve O. Harvey. The Ontourage nightclub is located at 157 W. Ontario, downtown Chicago. $10 admission, no drink minimum, 280 person capacity seating.

<body>Hoboken Museum Receives Generous $2,000 Gift from Hudson County Homing Pigeon Club Hoboken’s role in competitive pigeon racing is celebrated in new oral history chapbook based on recollections of HCHPC members Vinnie Torre and Lynne EaringThe Hoboken Historical Museum is pleased to announce a generous gift of $2,000 from the Hudson County Homing Pigeon Club, a portion of which will support the ongoing Hoboken Oral History Project, a joint project of the Hoboken Historical Museum and the Friends of the Hoboken Library. Museum Director Bob Foster and Board President Carol Losos visited the HCHPC in January to formally accept the donation from club president Vinnie Torre, with members Lynne Earing, James Corso and John Baginski depicted below...Vinnie Torre, who maintains the last active homing pigeon loft in Hoboken, and about eight members from nearby towns are keeping alive a proud history of a competitive sport that is still practiced around the world, but which has dwindled nearly out of sight in modern Hoboken. At one time, roofs of Hoboken’s brownstones and apartment buildings hosted more than 70 pigeon lofts, and HCHPC’s membership exceeded 70 dues-paying members. This year, the club is reviving its nationally renowned race, the Hoboken One-Bird Derby, this fall, October 29 – 31, a tradition that dates back to 1922, when the club was founded. In the late 1960s – 1970s, Hoboken was one of the hot spots of the competitive racing pigeon community, sponsoring the Hoboken One-Bird Derby, which drew competitors from across the country and another 20 races during the year. Half were in the spring for the veteran birds, and half in the early fall for the young birds. Hoboken’s HCHPC moved to its current club headquarters at 358 Newark Street in 1946. The building continues to serve as a club meeting place, but also doubles as a rehearsal and recording studio for local musicians. The sport has faded with the proliferation of municipal restrictions, and also of hawks, a dire threat to even the speediest of the elite racers. Club members hasten to explain that their “thoroughbreds of the sky” are carefully bred and cared for, sharing little with the common feral birds that populate urban centers like Hoboken. The sport is still enthusiastically followed in other countries, with million-dollar purse races in South Africa and Asia, and enthusiasts in Belgium, Holland and the United Kingdom. Pigeon racing fans include the Queen of England, actor Jimmy Smits and boxer Mike Tyson. It featured prominently in the movie “On the Waterfront,” which was filmed on location in Hoboken, including the rooftop coops on tenement buildings.On Sunday, March 14 at 4 p.m., the Museum will release its twentieth oral history chapbook, The Pigeon Guys: Recollections of Vinnie Torre and Lynne Earing, on Sunday. Please join us at the Museum, 1301 Hudson Street, for this free event, during which copies of the chapbook will be distributed, refreshments served, and stories told about Hoboken’s pigeon flyers—past and present. Vinnie Torre has been racing pigeons since the mid-1950s, when veteran “pigeon guys” passed along their skills, and occasionally their birds, to “the kid.” During the local club’s dormant years, Vinnie continued to raise and train birds at his “Hillside Loft,” and to enter and win races state- and nationwide. In the late 1990s, he met Lynne Earing, a Bayonne animal lover who was soon sharing his life and his enthusiasm for the sport. It did not take long for Vinnie to build “Lynne’s Loft,” alongside his own.Lisa Sartori interviewed Vinnie Torre and Lynne Earing on Vinnie’s roof last spring. The transcript of their interview, from which the chapbook was derived, has been deposited in the collections of the Hoboken Public Library and the Hoboken Historical Museum. Holly Metz edited the interview, Kevin McCloskey contributed drawings, Robert Foster added photographs, and Ann Marie Manca designed the chapbook. Please do visit the Museum on March 14 and celebrate its release with us.About the Hoboken Historical MuseumFounded 1986, the M...</body></row>

          One night every year in late January, volunteers hit the streets after midnight to count the city's unsheltered homeless population. But the late-night hours and police escorts likely prevent some of the homeless from being included in the tally. Enter Katie Kitchin, former director of the Norfolk, Virginia, Office to End Homelessness. After her husband was tapped to run the Memphis Brooks Museum of Art, Kitchin began consulting Memphis on how to get better results and more information from its?

After the holidays, tired of the cooking from my own kitchen, I treated my family to the cooking from Ken Lumpkin’s Midtown restaurant, Umai.
I’d heard that Lumpkin, who opened his Japanese and French cuisine restaurant three years ago, had rolled out smaller plates and lower prices, which sounded good to me after the excesses of Christmas. 
“Now you can spend $15 and get two or three plates, but the quality of the food is still the same,” Lumpkin said, explaining how his new menu reflects more affordable prices and lessons learned from his mother, Sumiko.

<body>Anne Kingsbury
So far, we've taken a look at a number of artists and designers who have incorporated deer symbolism into their work. But what about when the hide itself becomes a canvas? Local artist Anne Kingsbury has been beading on a large deer hide since 1996. The naturally pliable, yet resilient material is ideal for beadwork. Row by row, section by section, thousands of beads have been sewn tightly onto the velvety hide. Some are so tiny that you can barely see them. The artist uses these &quot;baby beads&quot; to create a richer surface that is slightly lower and more dense than the average seed bead. Radiating out from the center of the piece are colorful lists of ordinary events. They splay out in several directions, separated here and there by imaginative figures. Although her words are in English, there is an undeniable rhythm in the work that is universally appealing. Areas yet to be completed are outlined in black. The artist plans on beading all the way out to the delicately frayed edges.
It is clear that the process has been a treasured exploration, a rich experience that has unfolded slowly over time. Kingsbury reflects, &quot;If you go on a journey, you don't always know what's going to happen when you are on that journey.&quot; Her work will be displayed in A Torrent of Words, a John Michael Kohler Arts Center exhibit, February 21 - May 30, 2010. The show features twenty five artists who incorporate written or spoken language into diverse bodies of work.

<body>Protein shakes aren't the only drinks that contain raw eggs. A number of high-end bars and lounges have started using raw egg whites and raw egg yolks in their cocktails, and according to the Times, drink makers believe they are under attack from the city due to overblown salmonella concerns. Rumors of the raw egg crackdown stem from a Jan. 19 health code violation leveled against SoHo's Pegu Club because a barkeep allegedly didn't tell a patron his drink included raw eggs. 

Though the menu lists &quot;raw egg white&quot; as an ingredient in the Earl Grey MarTEAni and includes a disclaimer stating &quot;the consumption of raw eggs can be hazardous,&quot; a health inspector reportedly issued a violation because a bartender didn't inform a drinker who hadn't looked at the menu that his order contained raw eggs. Though the city has downgraded the offense to less severe infraction, Pegu Club has pulled the drink from its menu and cocktail insiders are scared. &quot;If they make it illegal to serve egg-white drinks, that would be Hurricane Katrina for us,&quot; said a bartender or club owner who wisely wished to remain anonymous. 

City rules stipulate that eggs must be heated to 145 degrees or more for 15 seconds &quot;unless an individual consumer requests&quot; the use of a raw egg. &quot;We think, if it rises to the level of risk, then you have to let the buyer beware,&quot; said an associate health commissioner. But Pegu Club owner Audrey Saunders scoffed at the city's recommendation of using pasteurized eggs because they &quot;impart this really funky wet-diaper nose,&quot; unlike the &quot;ethereal mouth feel&quot; produced by real raw eggs.</body></row>

<body>Listen up, chocoholics: Your fix has arrived.
City Bakery’s annual Hot Chocolate Festival kicks off tomorrow with a rotating menu that highlights a different version of the sweetly warming quaff each day. The cocoa celebration, which continues through the end of February, began in 1992 after owner Maury Rubin hosted a party for customers that featured seven different flavors.
Although Rubin admits he’s especially fond of what he calls quiet, nuanced tastes, like bourbon hot chocolate and vanilla bean, he says, “They’re all like my children.”
CHECK OUT THE POST'S EVENTS PAGE

But lest patrons tire of caramel or banana-peel hot chocolate — two of the most popular flavors — the bakery introduces a new one during the festival. This year, it’s a “Moulin Chocolate Rouge,” an invention incorporating dark chocolate, espresso, pomegranate and lemon.
“It’s a little bit of a jumble,” Rubin says, “but it’s a very exotic ride.”
Other off-beat flavors include a “tropical” hot chocolate — a combination of banana, orange, lemon, grapefruit and coconut — and a Valentine’s Day-themed “Love Potion” concoction, which Rubin calls “gentle, but heavy-duty” and features the bakery’s homemade hot fudge sauce poured on top of hot chocolate.
More of a white chocolate fan? Head to the bakery on Feb. 24 for the “Ode to the Polar Bear” hot chocolate, the only version on the menu for adherents of the snow-colored stuff.
Adding to the wintry feeling of the festival is the bakery’s “Night of Knitting” event, slated for Feb. 18, an evening of — you guessed it — cocoa and knitting. Guests will participate in a series of workshops with six city-based knitting stores and, of course, sip unlimited amounts of the 10 flavors served that night.
As if you needed another excuse to go.
City Bakery: 3 W. 18th St., at Fifth Avenue; 212-366-1414. For a full schedule, visit hotchocolatefestival.com.

<body>From the Architect's Newspaper:The federally owned plaza where Richard Serra’s controversial Tilted Arc sculpture once stood—and now sprawls landscape architect Martha Schwartz’s composition of planted mounds and bright-green curling benches—is getting another makeover this spring. The General Services Administration (GSA) has confirmed that Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates will redesign the public space in front of the Jacob K. Javits Federal Building, working under lead architect Wank Adams Slavin Associates (WASA).The new design for the plaza, at the intersection of Lafayette and Worth streets in Lower Manhattan, will be the site’s fourth iteration in just over 20 years, taking into account temporary landscaping that occupied the space for eight years between the 1989 removal of Serra’s wall of weathered steel and the construction of Schwartz’s design. The GSA said the work is being principally undertaken to repair the waterproofing of a parking garage beneath the plaza, which makes the project eligible for funds from last year’s American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The two-year, $5 million to $10 million endeavor entails the demolition of the existing plaza, reinforcement and repair of the parking garage roof, and installation of landscaping, lighting, security features, and other elements.</body></row>

<body>New York native and Brooklyn newcomer Scott Hardkiss has been starting parties the world over as a DJ over the last two decades.On February 20, the Fort Greene resident lays it down at home for a special engagement at Knitting Factory in Williamsburg.The late-night event – called “The Underwater Ball,” borrowed from the title of a track of his debut album, 2009’s “Technicolor Dreamer” – is made even more special, as it marks the reunion of Hardkiss and Robbie behind the tables. Back in the early 1990s, the two, along with Gavin, comprised the producing team Hardkiss, playing the underground San Francisco club scene.Still going strong, these days, Scott Hardkiss,  who has made several remixes for everyone from Elton John to the Flaming Lip, and has scored films for the likes of Wes Anderson and Spike Jones, is further reinventing himself with his Technicolor Dreamer Band, blending electronic dance grooves with live vocal and instrumental hooks.The ball will include a live set from Hardkiss’s band, with help from friends Britta Philips (of the bands Dean &amp; Britta and Luna), Lisa Shaw (Naked Music), Stevvi Alexander, Bobby Harden, J Bowman, A Guy Called Guy, and the drummer Guy Licata (Santigold, Hercules &amp; Love Affair).Kicking things off will be sets by DJ Phunkae &amp; The Prophetz. And in keeping with the theme of the night, Brooklyn artists Glenn Friedel and Chris Herbeck will be behind the visuals, props and set design.Tickets are $10 in advance, or $15 at the door. It all kicks off at 11 p.m. at Knitting Factory (361 Metropolitan Ave.). For more information call 347-529-6696.</body></row>

<body>Commercial services firm Cushman &amp; Wakefield picked Glenn Rufrano, the head of an Australian-based owner of shopping centers, to replace outgoing CEO Bruce Mosler, the company said in a statement this morning. He will assume the position March 22. Rufrano is the outgoing CEO at Centro Properties Group, a position he has held for two years. He has been with Centro since it bought the large American shopping center real estate investment trust New Plan Excel Realty Trust in 2007, where he had been CEO. “We are confident that Glenn has the vision to lead Cushman &amp; Wakefield, creating meaningful value for our clients, employees and other stakeholders,&quot; said Carlo Barel di Sant’Albano, a Cushman &amp; Wakefield board member and CEO of EXOR, the Italian investment company of the Agnelli family which owns Cushman. Cushman &amp; Wakefield had said it was considering bringing in a new CEO from outside the real estate industry, but went with a veteran with a long record in real estate. Mosler will step down as CEO, but remain at the firm as co-chairman of the board, a position he took Jan. 1 this year. He announced he would step down in October. Lawrence Longua, clinical associate professor at the Schack Institute
of Real Estate at New York University, said Rufrano helped turn around
New Plan, after the REIT ran into trouble through aggressive
over-expansion. &quot;He is very smart and knows real estate at the
property level,&quot; Longua said. &quot;Glenn was brought in and restructured
[New Plan] and strengthened the balance sheet.&quot;</body></row>

<body>A year into the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, Newsweek checks in with a few local loan recipients.  The big question: Did the money doled out by the government work as a stimulus or stopgap? The Polytechnic Institute of New York University picked up $4.2 million to put towards research on renewable energy, which could eventually result in new jobs and cheaper energy resources.  However, for Peter Byrners, owner of the seven-person graphic design firm Lúgh Studio Inc. (at 138 Union Street, near Columbia Street), the $150,000 loan he received &quot;enabled him to pay an outstanding American Express bill and payroll taxes, and provided a much-needed cash cushion. But it did not help him hire new workers, restore his company's health insurance, or reinstate the employees' 20 percent pay cut.&quot;  Greenwich Street Equities took out a loan to build Choice Hotel (at 611 DeGraw St, between Third and Fourth avenues), but it'll be spent entirely on temporary jobs: &quot;The $1.5 million loan for the boutique hotel will employ 50 to 60 subcontractors and construction workers until the property is completed.&quot;

<body>Coney Island’s going back to the big time, as the city announced last Wednesday that the amusement wizards behind the popular Victorian Gardens theme park will begin running an amusement park by the Boardwalk this summer — and they’re using the throwback name Luna Park!
Zamperla, an Italy-based manufacturer of amusement park rides that has also gotten into the theme park business with its popular attraction in Manhattan’s Central Park every summer, has won the city contract for an unspecified, but up to 10-year, run as the faded funhouse’s newest, biggest draw.
The contract comes with big expectations: the Economic Development Corporation has a much broader vision of a revived Coney Island that will see the former People’s Playground transformed into a 24-7, all-year entertainment, amusement, games and retail zone — one that will take at least a decade to realize.
Until that Xanadu can be built, Zamperla will bring in its rides — though the actual amusements remain undecided — and begin operating by this summer.
“We’re excited,” said EDC spokesman Dave Lombino. “But we can’t comment on the rides or the selection process until the agreement is finalized.”
Though details remain sketchy, the EDC did require all would-be interim operators to provide an “open and affordable” pay-as-you-go experience in Coney. Zamperla’s track record in that area includes Victorian Gardens operation, which offers all-day unlimited rides for $21.50 that has proven very popular.
Nearby attraction operators are excited to see such a big name coming to Coney Island. Dennis Vourderis, manager of the enormous Deno’s Wonder Wheel Park, said he and his father have been working with the amusement titan since 1979.
“They’ve been around a long time and they’re still qualified,” Vourderis said. “Plus, a rising tide raises all ships, so we’re happy to hear the news.”
Zamperla CEO Alberto Zamperla told his hometown newspaper, Il Giornale di Vincenza, that the amusement area would be named Luna Park, in honor of one of the four original theme parks that made Coney Island an internationally known brand. Luna Park operated from 1903 until burning down in 1945.
The new Luna Park will eventually operate on all three parcels of land between the former Astroland site and Keyspan Park that the city bought from major Coney landowner Joe Sitt last year — though only the Astroland plot — at Surf Avenue and West 10th Street — is required to be ready by this summer. 
Astroland’s former owner Carol Albert, who initially hoped to bid for the interim amusement park, said the announcement of Zamperla’s winning bid was bittersweet.
“Reluctantly, we pulled out at the last minute because we could not possibly put [a proposal] together in the six weeks that the [EDC] required,” said Albert, who sold her land to Sitt in 2006 and ran her park as a renter until 2008. “But Zamperla will provide great rides and a beautiful experience like they did with Victorian Gardens.”
Zamperla got the city contract over a handful of other American would-be operators, including Ripley Entertainment, Atlantic City Steel Pier, International Great Wolf Resorts, Six Flags, the Rockwell Group and Palace Entertainment.
The city plans to spend $2.2 million, mostly to bring in electrical generators and portable toilets, though Zamperla is expected to build permanent restrooms and take over the electric bill in future years.

<body>Despite making the playoffs in just 13 of their 50 seasons, the Jets have played some of the NFL’s more significant postseason games, from Joe Namath’s Super Bowl guarantee to the Mud Bowl to Mark Gastineau’s roughing the passer penalty. The Post takes a look, chronologically, at the Jets’ Top 10 tournament games:
1968 AFL Championship

Jets 27, Raiders 23

In their only AFL Championship game appearance, the Jets earned a trip to Super Bowl III with their victory over the Raiders at Shea Stadium. Down 23-20 halfway through the fourth quarter, Joe Namath threw a touchdown pass to Don Maynard to give the Jets the lead. The Raiders’ final shot at a comeback failed when linebacker Ralph Baker pounced on Daryle Lamonica’s mishandled lateral to Charlie Smith deep in Jets territory with less than two minutes to go.
Super Bowl III

Jets 16, Colts 7

The most famous Jets game turned out to be one of the most important games in NFL history. After the NFL’s Green Bay Packers easily had won each of the first two Super Bowls, Joe Namath guaranteed his Jets, 18-point underdogs in the game, would defeat the 13-1 Baltimore Colts. The Jets did just that. Namath went 17-for-28 for 206 yards and was named the game’s MVP, and the Jets jumped out to a 16-0 lead before the Colts scored late in the fourth. The Jets defense forced five turnovers, and Matt Snell, to this day, is the only Jet to score a touchdown in the Super Bowl.
1982 AFC Divisional

Jets 17, Raiders 14

After crushing the Bengals 44-17 in the first round, the Jets took their road show to Los Angeles and jumped out to a 10-0 lead at halftime before the Raiders scored twice in the third quarter on a touchdown run by Marcus Allen and a touchdown pass from Jim Plunkett to Malcolm Barnwell. But the Jets regained the lead in the fourth quarter on a Scott Dierking 1-yard-run with 3:45 remaining. Wesley Walker caught seven passes for 169 yards and a touchdown, Freeman McNeil ran for 105 yards, and Lance Mehl had two fourth-quarter interceptions.
1982 AFC Championship

Dolphins 14, Jets 0

Known as “The Mud Bowl,” the Jets were upset by the Dolphins’ decision not to cover the field at the Orange Bowl. After the teams slogged through a scoreless first half, Miami linebacker A.J. Duhe intercepted a Richard Todd pass in the third quarter, leading to a Woody Bennett touchdown from 7 yards out. Duhe then sealed Miami’s victory when he intercepted a screen pass and returned it 35 yards for a touchdown. Todd threw five picks in the game.
1986 AFC Divisional

Browns 23, Jets 20 (2 OT)

Freeman McNeil’s 25-yard touchdown with 4:14 remaining in the fourth quarter gave the Jets what seemed like an insurmountable 20-10 lead over the Browns. But Cleveland scored a touchdown, thanks largely to a roughing-the-passer penalty on Jets defensive end Mark Gastineau on third-and-24. After a Jets three-and-out, the Browns tied it on Mark Moseley’s field goal with :07 to go. After Moseley missed a 23-yard field goal in the first overtime, he kicked the game-winning 27-yarder with 12:58 remaining in the second OT.
1998 AFC Divisional

Jets 34, Jaguars 24

After getting a bye as the AFC’s No. 2 seed, the Jets dominated, holding the ball for 39:16. They jumped out to a 17-0 lead thanks to two touchdowns — one rushing, one receiving — by Keyshawn Johnson. Two 1-yard TD runs by Curtis Martin then made it 31-14. The Jaguars didn’t go down without a fight, closing to 31-24 on a Jimmy Smith TD reception from Mark Brunell and a Mike Hollis field goal. But after intercepting a Vinny Testaverde pass in the end zone, Donovin Darius attempted to bring the ball out and was tackled at the 1. Jacksonville failed to get a first down, turning the ball over on downs, and a John Hall field goal iced the game.
1998 AFC Championship

Broncos 23, Jets 10

Curtis Martin’s 1-yard TD run helped the Jets take a 10-0 lead into halftime, putting them as close as they had been to the Super Bowl in 30 years. But the defending champion Broncos would score 23 unanswered points, led by league MVP Terrell Davis’ 167 yards and a touchdown. ...</body></row>

<body>Hold your breath. The warm  smell   of musty feathers and wet chicken feces that waft out of some local storefronts can be an assault to the senses.  But for many Bushwick residents the stink is a minor nuisance to suffer for access to the freshest meat -- from an animal they select.

The 18-year-old victim, whose name was not immediately released, was shot at least five times outside the Marcy Houses in Bedford-Stuyvesant just before 2:30 p.m. 
He was pronounced dead a short time later at Woodhull Hospital. 
His father is a 22-year NYPD veteran who works at the Brooklyn North Warrant Squad and has been a detective for six years. 
The shooter fled. 
Police suspect the shooting was in retaliation for a prior dispute.
Sources said the victim, who lives with his mother, had a &quot;minor criminal record.&quot;</body></row>

<body>A doctor testified this morning that alleged cop-sodomy victim Michael Mineo was suffering from an anal tear when he appeared at Brookdale University Hospital - and said it was &quot;highly unlikely&quot; that the injury was self-inflicted.
Dr. Syed Ahmed said Mineo arrived on Oct. 15, 2008, immediately after the alleged attack inside the Prospect Park subway station, with elevated pulse and white blood cell count - sure signs of a serious inflammatory response.
Although Ahmed conceded that the tear was &quot;superficial,&quot; doctors saw some bleeding and a CT scan showed that one of Mineo's pelvic muscles was inflamed and swollen.
Shown the baton of Police Officer Richard Kern, who's charged with the assault, and asked if the tear was consistent with being violated by the object, Ahmed said &quot;could be.&quot;
But he added that tests for pre-existing conditions came back negative, and that no normal human could inflict such an injury on himself.
&quot;It will cause intense pain, and you could not proceed,&quot; he said.
Mineo checked himself out of Brookdale on Oct. 19, against medical advice, but went to Brooklyn Hospital Center on the 23rd after symptoms worsened.
There, doctors drained six ounces of pus from an abcess that had formed in the inflamed muscle after it became infected, Ahmed said.
Lawyers for Kern and his co-defendants, Alex Cruz and Andrew Morales, who are charged with covering up the attack, suggested that the inflamed muscle was too far from the anus to be related to the tear.
The gambit prompted laughter from Ahmed, who told Cruz's lawyer, Stuart London, &quot;You don't have any idea about the human anatomy.&quot;

<body>By Cayte Grieve		  	February 05, 2010 
	  				 	 			 				The Super Bowl is an event not just because of the football, but because of the food. It's an excuse to get plastered and snack on unfashionably delicious bar food on a Sunday afternoon, football fan or not. The wonderful thing about this is that restaurants often &quot;go deep&quot; and present their offerings in a catering-friendly form, so you can either (A) come to the party with the best snacks or (B) host one at your own digs, and not have to worry about preparing oven-baked sheet after sheet of Pizza Rolls and Bagel Bites, or even worse, trying to get someone to deliver during the game. Of course, there's always pizza, which you can order a few hours before the day of, but why go for the normal grub when you can hit something slightly more exotic. In other words: which restaurants are helping New Yorkers get one through the uprights, and bringing forth good grub to the game? 
	 	  (’’)Momofuku Ssam Bar 

All those who place their bets on David Chang to deliver the goods will be pleased to know that he’s again offering the Bo Ssam—a motherlode of whole slow-roasted pork shoulder, with all the fixings: napa kimchi, ginger scallion sauce, caramelized onion, horseradish crème fraiche, bibb lettuce—along with some awesome sides--smoked chicken wings, red onion cole slaw, yukon gold potato salad, baked adzuki beans with bacon--and one of the best desserts the MomoEmpire has to offer--a dozen compost cookies--for $325 this year. Better get on it, though: today (February 4th) is the last day they’re going to be taking orders. Not exactly a hail mary, though: Momofuku’s a pretty surefire bet, year-to-year, Super Bowl or not.


BLT Burger 

The haute Village burger stand (whose burger received notable approval from us last year) rolls out their own special for four, eight, or 15 people (priced respectively at $60, $120, $225). They’re packing in burgers, fried snacks (onion rings, skinny fries, sweet potato fries, waffle fries, fried dill pickles), along with chicken wings and waffle bites. Even better, orders can be places and picked up the day of the game, but call ‘em in early, unless you feel like missing the halftime show.


Kefi 

Upper West Siders going slightly more highbrow than the average fried fatfest can hit up star chef Michael Psilakis’ casual Greek digs for something a little more exotic than the typical Super Bowl spread. 6-8 people can get Psilakis’ homemade pita “chips” with tzatziki dip, hummus, Greek salad and Kefi’s meatballs—which are, by far and away, the restaurant’s standout dish—along with spinach mac and cheese, some Spetsofai pasta (rigatoni, sausage and peppers), and your choice of Souvlaki or Roasted Chicken, which also comes with a side of lemon potatoes. You can call in an order to the restaurant for $49.95 day of, and get it delivered in the neighborhood at no extra charge. That said, someone’s working on the Super Bowl, delivering your food, while you’re partying. Tip well, lest you get sacked by bad karma. 


MacBar 

One of those party dishes nobody’s ever gone wrong with, ever—Mac and Cheese—can be brought to the table in a style naturally befitting New Yorkers, which is to say, a variety of flavors including truffle oil, lobster, any number of cheeses, among others. MacBar’s got 12 different flavors, and they’re putting the entire menu up for catering 16 to 20 people, priced anywhere from $40 - $70. Orders need to be placed at least by Saturday, and when you pick ‘em up, make sure you get a cabbie who can keep the meter running, lest you get stuck on a Nolita corner with a massive tureen of hot, gooey noodles without a ride to move ‘em. 


Acme Bar &amp; Grill and Great Jones Cafe 

We couldn’t make a list without giving due diligence to New Orleans fans, who have some of the best native food in the country. Good Cajun food’s hard to find in the city, but Acme does delivery via Seamless Web, and they have an entire menu of PoBoys and a kitchen that could pull oof a party of ‘em. It certainly isn’t the “fanciest” of the ...</body></row>

<body>The Hopkins Center for the Arts couldnt have found a more fitting and inspiring opener for its new series Take Five Tuesdays than James Cotton. His once-mighty voice has been diminished by throat surgery and radiation therapy but, at 74, he still plays a ferocious harmonica. Sonny Boy Williamson taught him, Muddy Waters hired him and Cotton started fronting his own band in the mid-1960s. Others in the series include R&amp;B powerhouse Bettye LaVette and bluegrassers the Traveling McCourys. Each concert will be preceded by a 6 p.m. social hour. Jon Bream

<body>On Tuesday, January 19, at 7:30pm, Ellen Sandbeck discusses Green Barbarians: Live Bravely on Your Home Planet. This event is co-sponsored by Twin Cities Green. To whet your appetite, here's an excerpt from the book's preface. From Green Barbarians: Live Bravely on Your Home Planet“I got the idea for this book as my husband and I were eating a picnic lunch in front of a bonfire in our back four. (We own five acres. A back forty is beyond our capabilities.) My husband, who is more domestic than I, brought a tray loaded with a lovely post-Thanksgiving feast: hot spiced apple cider in a jar; capicola ham; smoked cheese; homemade bread; goat cheese; apples; and pumpkin pie. I was happily contemplating the prospect of enhancing my garden beds with charcoal dust from the soon-to-bequenched fire, and wondering whether I should wipe the capicola grease on my husband’s pants, since he had forgotten to bring out napkins, and his pants were dirtier than mine, when it occurred to me that a barbarian would wipe her hands on her slice of bread. So I did, and as I did, I realized that it might be time to resurrect the concepts of bread-napkins, trenchers, and other premodern conveniences. After much labor, and many more than nine months later, this book was born. It is filled with domestic strategies both ancient and modern--—many delicious, all amusing--that I hope will improve the lives of ecologically minded people, and perhaps serve as a guide to the more feral side of life.“Those who walk the wilder, less-trodden path have always served as scouts for the rest of us. These venturesome souls are the explorers, the discoverers, the early adopters who help blaze the trails that will eventually take the rest of us where we need to go. Human survival has always depended upon intrepid individuals who cannot wait to discover what is just around the bend, on the other side of the river, or beyond the hills. They call to us from cliff tops, treetops, and mountaintops, saying, “Look! We’ve just found a new food or water source, a good place to make camp, or toolmaking material.” Nowadays, many of these seekers wave to us from bicycles and skateboards, from cars that belch french fry–scented exhaust, from thrift stores and rooftop gardens, even from Dumpsters.“Almost immediately after the atrocious attacks in September 2001, the Powers That Be strongly urged us to go shopping; they informed us that our economy rested upon the backs of shoppers, without whom our entire culture would collapse. This may have been the first time in recorded history that a government deployed shoppers to protect a country from attack. Now perhaps the renegades among us who delight in thumbing their noses at (and sometimes even sticking their thumbs into the eyes of) the agropharmo-military-industrial complex may reasonably be considered members of a new tribe of barbarians: the Green Barbarians.“The classical Greek and Latin definitions of barbarian simply meant one who was not of the dominant culture, and who was therefore considered strange or bizarre. Green Barbarians are those who define themselves by what they do and what they create, what they save and what they preserve, rather than by what they buy and what they consume. Thus the horde of Green Barbarians marches firmly upstream, against the flow of consumerist propaganda.”Excerpted from Green Barbarians: How to Live Bravely on Your Home Planet by Ellen Sandbeck.

<body>Jazzy renderings are all well and good, but which ambitious city projects will actually come to fruition? Crain’s put six of the most talked-about developments under the microscope -- the Hudson Yards development, Moynihan Station, Javits Center, Willets Point, Atlantic Yards and Ground Zero -- examining which was most likely to go from rendering to reality. Hudson Yards gets a top rating from Crain’s, which pointed out that the city has actually out-paced the private developer, Related Companies, also involved in the project. The plans for Ground Zero, however, appear “grim,” with delays likely to continue hampering the project’s progress. The remaining four projects have mixed outlooks. The well-tempered expectations for the Javits Center could help matters in the long-run, although numerous past attempts to move the expansion project forward have ended in failure. As for Moynihan Station, it may be too early to tell, but Crain’s pointed out that the developers are now taking a “phased approach” toward garnering approval, a move that could help them garner approval and financing. Willets Point and Atlantic Yards, meanwhile, both suffer from a lack of community support and financing difficulties.</body></row>

  the arena itself would be too big and expensive  
  the theater inside the arena isn't being promoted for graduations  
  new, city-financed competition is emerging

<body>Ground Report, Gubernatorial Candidate Challenges New York Establishment  


  Albany lawyer Warren Redlich anounced his candidacy for New York governor on Monday, Feb. 1st at 10am in the Legislative Correspondents Association Press Room in the Legislative Office Building. Currently serving on the Guilderland, NY  Town Board, Redlich will seek the Republican and Libertarian Party nominations. The theme of his campaign  is &quot;Stop Wasting Money.&quot; 
  ...  
  
  He hopes to create a movement for regime change in New York uniting supporters of the Ron Paul and Tea Party movements with Greens, Democrats, independents and  others who are likewise opposed to corporate welfare. He opposed the Wall Street bailouts.  
  
  Redlich calls for elimination of state government departments such as the Empire State Development Corporation which promote corporate welfare and eminent domain abuse.   He opposes instances of eminent domain abuse such as Willets Point in Queens, Atlantic Yards in Brooklyn and Columbia's scheme in West Harlem.  


NoLandGrab: And, unlike some gubernatorial candidates, it's a safe bet that he will neither seek, nor accept, any campaign donations from Bruce C. Ratner.  

MultifamilyInvestor, NY to Atlantic Yards Developer: Finish By…2035?!  


  What will happen by 2035?  
  
  Muslims will outnumber Christians in Britain.  
  
  China will surpass the U.S. economically.  
  
  Jerusalem will lose its Jewish majority, if those predictions are accurate.  
  
  In addition, 2035 is also the deadline the City and State of New York have given to Forest City Ratner to complete the Atlantic Yards project.  


NLG: Yet Ratner and the City and the State all still swear that the project will be done in 10 years. Trust them.

<body>Atlantic Yards Report  


  At an interview and panel discussion sponsored by BISNOW on Wednesday February 24, Atlantic Yards was mentioned as an example several times by Seth Pinsky, president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYC EDC), and MaryAnne Gilmartin, the Forest City Ratner executive in charge of Atlantic Yards.  
  
  While Pinsky said &quot;we hope to break ground in just a matter of weeks&quot; on Atlantic Yards, perhaps the most interesting statements concerned the unsaid: while he asserted that the city's projects emerge from community consultation and that the best way to proceed was via RFPs (Requests for Proposals), Atlantic Yards proceeded differently.  
  
  Gilmartin expressed frustration at the lack of coordination among government agencies working on Atlantic Yards, without acknowledging that, while that certainly may slow things down, it also can give the developer the upper hand.  
  
  She also asserted that, in contrast to the example of Stuyvesant Town, Forest City has avoided the &quot;exuberance&quot; of inflated expectations--even though a report from KPMG on Atlantic Yards housing suggests similar expectations.

<body>Here's another community-submitted bit of intel from the field (again from L.A., what is this!?!) from Lara B. (aka &quot;Leebo&quot; in Slice/SeriousEats-land). Thanks, Lara! And remember, if YOU want to submit your review, here's how. ?The Mgmt.

Terroni
7605 Beverly Boulevard, Los Angeles CA 90036 (at Curson; map); 323-954-0300; terroni.ca
Pizza style: Neapolitan
Oven type: Electric
Price: $12 to $17 for medium (the only size)


Being a recent transplant to Los Angeles, I discovered that great pizza is actually hard to find here. Well, it wasn't that big of a surprise, but I was on a mission nonetheless. I had sampled my fair share of the tourist traps around Hollywood and visited some neighborhood pizzerias recommended by friends, but I knew in just one bite of my first Neapolitan-style pizza at Terroni that I had found my local favorite. I discovered the place by chance when a friend who was visiting LA for her birthday chose Terroni for dinner since it was close to her hotel. Now, maybe I need to kiss a few more toads to find my prince, but so far, this is my favorite pizza in LA... to date. Terroni is a traditional Southern Italian restaurant with three other locations in Toronto, where they first opened in 1992.

Although they are more of a restaurant than a pizzeria, they do pizza like they mean it and give serious attention to the quality and authenticity of their pies. What makes their pizza spectacular is the quality of ingredients and the close attention to details. First, all of their dough is kneaded and formed by hand. The pizza crust is very thin, firm with just the right give, chewy, and charred to perfection. Their simple tomato sauce is made with DOP San Marzano tomatoes. There is no hint of herbs or garlic in the sauce, just pure, unadulterated tomato. While they offer a selection of about 30 pizzas, I have not tried any other than their Bufalina. I have a bad habit of falling in love and becoming monogamous. The Bufalina is a simple Neapolitan-style pizza with picked-from-the-vine tomato sauce, fresh and creamy buffalo milk mozzarella, and basil. Along with expected pies, some of Terroni's toppings include speck, hot calabrese salame, hot cacciatore salame, prosciutto di Parma, and rapini. The cheeses include smoked scamorza, spicy auricchio provolone, ricotta, gorganzola, Italian mascarpone, and fontina. But as delicious as these ingredients sound, and as hard as I try, I just can't bring myself to cheat on my beloved Bufalina. But I promise to try harder next time.

As a side note, one of the first things I noticed about the Terroni pizza is that they do not slice the pie for you. Yes, you read that correctly. You are handed a knife and fork with a whole pie and are expected to cut the pizza yourself. At first I thought this was a bit strange, if not barbaric (I actually thought it was an actor's mistake), but after trying that first hand-cut slice, I was quickly over that quirk. Terroni's motto is, &quot;No modifications, No substitutions, No reservations, No exceptions.&quot; In our current culture of &quot;I want what I want when I want it,&quot; some part of me really admires that.

So who says there are no great pizzas in LA? Not this recent transplant. ?Leebo

<body>This week's concert preview is being brought to you by Kevin Meenan of Epicsauce, providing detailed concert listings for the Bay Area every week. Follow them on Twitter.

    Nosaj Thing. 


An absolutely packed week of shows with the previously profiled Thee Oh Sees alongside epicsauce favorite Ty Segall at Cafe du Nord on Tuesday, local post-punk heavyweights Tempo No Tempo at Bottom of the Hill Wednesday, and SF transplants Thao With the Get Down Stay Down with Portland's The Thermals at the Great American Music Hall Friday.

Our pick for this week, however, is Los Angeles beatmaker Nosaj Thing -- aka 24 year old electronic wizard Jason Chung -- at Mighty Saturday. His  2009 full length debut Drift was easily one of last years most compelling releases, packed with twelve infectious tracks that fill a space somewhere between fellow L.A. beat-head Flying Lotus and Entroducing era DJ Shadow. Armed with a laptop, midi controller and an arsenal of his own bedroom-brewed beats, Chung takes on the roll of conductor in his live sets, mashing up the various elements of each song to create a sort of live remix of his work -- each show is fully improvised, so no two sets ever sound entirely the same. With similar minded electronic acts Daedelus and Jogger rounding out the bill this one is well worth your $12.

Plenty of other options this week including Mates of State at Cafe Du Nord tonight, the always entertaining Jaguar Love (ex-Blood Brothers) at Café Du Nord Wednesday,and the previously profiled and all around awesome Mi Ami at El Rio Saturday -- as always, be sure to consult the full show list.

Did the B52s have a baby? Magick Casket starts off with some Rock Lobster-like weirdness, then transforms into something that sounds like TRex. Wood Full O' Witches starts off sounding like the theme to The Munsters, Thundering Fists O' the Lord sounds like a church revival meeting…this album is all over the place stylistically, but competently played. If you like deliberately wacky music you’ll love this.  
At The Stork Club (2330 Telegraph Avenue., Oakland) on February 12. 9p.m., $5

<body>Jazz legend Jimmy Scott is rolling through town this week, with two shows at Yoshi's in the Fillmore. Scott, the favorite singer of artists ranging from Billie Holiday to Nancy Wilson, is renowned for his high, pure contralto singing voice. Legendary in his time, he gained new fans after appearing on the final episode of David Lynch's Twin Peaks (adding an extra hint of creepiness to the show's famously spooky Black Lodge). He's since recorded a track with Lou Reed, performed with David Byrne, Michael Stipe, and Antony &amp; the Johnsons, and appeared at President Clinton's inauguration. He'll be performing with his band, the Jazz Expressions.
Scott's medical history is also fascinating: his high voice is the result of a genetic condition called Kallmann's syndrome, which prevents sufferers from reaching puberty by blocking the production of testosterone. Scott was stunted at the height of 4'11&quot; until age 37, when he began receiving testosterone supplements; subsequently, he went through puberty and grew eight inches, reaching his current height of 5'7&quot;. His small stature and high voice caused Lionel Hampton to nickname him &quot;Little Jimmy Scott,&quot; a moniker that's stuck to this day, despite his subsequent growth.
Jimmy Scott and the Jazz Expressions will appear Tuesday, February 23, and Wednesday, February 24, at Yoshi's, 1330 Fillmore St., Fillmore. Both shows are at 8 pm, and tickets are available for $18 at Yoshi's website.</body></row>

<body>Today is Fat Tuesday or &quot;Mardi Gras&quot; and according to Wikipedia historically refers to the yummy ritual of eating richer, fatty foods before the fasting of the Lenten Season, which starts on what is called Ash Wednesday.  But you know that Fat Tuesday is a synonym for &quot;party Tuesday&quot; in February.  It's a day to wear beads and masks and do things you'd normally not do on a &quot;school day&quot; let alone a &quot;school night&quot;.  But where do you go if you happen to shuttle between Atlanta and the San Francisco Bay Area?  Good question.  

In Oakland, Ozumo's on the corner of Broadway and Grand is hosting a celebration that starts at 5 PM PST and features the sounds of New Orleans by live entertainment and &quot;DJ Gray&quot;.  In addition there will be Fat Tuesday food specials and Brazilian drink specials.  

Right next door to Ozumo's free event, Pican's hosting a Fat Tuesday celebration, too, and that starts at 5:30 PM PST.  Pican will have beads, boas, &quot;traditional NOLA bites&quot;, Southern Comfort Hurricanes, and a cocktail called &quot;Bulleit Sazerac&quot; according to the report. In Pican's case, the cost is $75 at the door and $5 goes to Haitian relief.  But with that, Pican's a fun place:

  

But Broadway &amp; Grand's not the only place to go for Fat Tuesday in Oakland; you can head down to Jack London Square, too.  

Miss Pearls Jam House at The Waterfront Hotel where Broadway ends has a Fat Tuesday event which starts at 7 PM PST.  Miss Pearls' features live music with the Craig Caffall Band and an evening raffle.  

Of course, if you want to have a party on Fat Tuesday without the heafy entry fee, check out Lake Chalet at 1520 Lakeside Drive.  It's my favorite place to eat in Oakland, the bar is well-stocked, and it's always beads-friendly.  Plus, if it's a nice day in the evening, the Patio should be rocking!  The Lake Chalet is where I held my YouTube Meetup a while back:



Also, head over to Arizmendi Bakery on Lakeshore or in San Francisco for Fat Tuesday.  No cocktails, but they do have something called &quot;King Cake&quot;, a &quot;colorful Danish pastry with pecans&quot;!  Now, as a word of warning, it seems only the San Francisco Arizmendi has a Fat Tuesday-related happening, but check the Oakland Arizmendi Bakery anyway.  They're always full of unannounced surprises!  

Of course, if you want a more serious evening you can head over to the Oakland City Council Budget Session at the Oakland City Hall at 5 PM PST.  But after that gut-wrenching slice-and-dice party, you may very well be driven to drink, so wear your beads!  

Fat Tuesday in San Francisco, frankly, makes Oakland look like a kitchen match compared to the H-Bomb-sized number of events in &quot;The City&quot;.  Here's a link to a search for all that's going on this year, 2010:  FAT TUESDAY SAN FRANCISCO.  But if you need some direction, go to Ruby Skye and check out the band &quot;The Wonderbread 5&quot;. And of course, there's the Carnival celebration at the Mission Cultural Center that kicks off at 6 PM.  

For me, the place to go is The Balboa Cafe on the corner of Fillmore and Greenwich, where there's no cover charge, a lot of beads, bartenders Lance and Brian should be working tonight, and if you're single it's a ton of fun (no comment on what married people do there!).  

But what about Atlanta on Fat Tuesday?

The difference is the Fat Tuesday ethic is rich in Atlanta, even when it's not Fat Tuesday!  Again there's so much to do, that a search link works best for ya:  FAT TUESDAY ATLANTA.  But where to go from all of the choices?  Thee's the Mardi RA Masquerade Ball 2010 at RA Sushi at 1080 Peachtree St., Suite 8.  There, you join Baton Bob as he hold his  costume contest.  It starts at 8 PM and its free.  

The other place to go to is Parish Foods and Goods at 240 N. Highland Ave.  They've got an all day thing with oysters, all-you-can-eat treats, roasted pig, and red beans and rice.  Yum!  Check it out.

What ever you do, be safe and don't drink and drive.</body></row>

<body>From
the cover of Chanterelle's first menu by Marisol in 1979, to its last by Chuck
Close, which was completed after the restaurant was forced to close last July, the cult-favorite SoHo restaurant gathered more than 30 years of artwork by the likes of Cindy Sherman, Robert
Mapplethorpe, Bill Katz (the collection's curator), Allen Ginsberg, Cy
Twombly, Mathew Barney, Marcel Marceau, and Kara Walker. &quot;The idea was
to put art in people's hands, in an unpretentious accessible way, for
the earthiness and pleasure of holding something in your hand&quot; said
Chanterelle co-owner and doyenne Karen Waltuck about an exhibition of
the menus running through Tuesday night at denim repair and antiques boutique Kill Devil Hill, in
Greenpoint, Brooklyn.On the exhibition's unlikely location Waltuck said that when approached by
Kill Devil Hill's &quot;young, industrious renaissance-type&quot; proprietors about doing the exhibition,
she immediately loved the idea. The eclectic neighborhood, Waltuck said, with its ramshackle warehouses and burgeoning
art community, recalled SoHo and Chanterelle's early days when she and her co-owner David's artist friends gathered to eat in their
restaurant.</body></row>

<body>In light of the recent Picasso accident at the Met, it's sort of nerve-racking to see a masterpiece like this out in the open, no? One blogger recently spotted this painting being unloaded at the Guggenheim during lunchtime, noting how it &quot;is only clad in plastic wrapping and the 2 handlers look about as professional as the college stoners I used to hire to move my Ikea furniture in a minivan.&quot; And what artist gets this kind of handling? Joan Miró, who is certainly worthy of some bubble wrap, at least.

We contacted the Guggenheim to clarify what exactly is happening in this photo, and in the meantime, MOBIA director of exhibitions Paul Tabor has enlightened us about the practice of handling art in museums. He tells us &quot;there are two types of specialized packing methods for works of art, hard crating and soft crating. Both begin by wrapping the art in glycine paper and then a layer of foam or bubble wrap to give it a cushion of air. Hard crating involves placing the artwork into slots inside a larger wooden box. With soft crating, cardboard is wrapped around the frame of the work and then it’s packed into larger cardboard boxes.&quot; 

Hard crating, soft crating... it still looks like that Miró could use some more protection around the surface! If something is damaged while at the museum, we're told the museum's insurance policy is responsible... but what about when it's on the truck?

UPDATE: the Guggenheim enlightens us some more, saying, &quot;As a matter of policy, we do not discuss specific security and registrar arrangements as they pertain to the handling and transportation of art works. The museum observes and as appropriate, exceeds, the highest level of safety and security measures in the industry. The item in question was transported according to the strictest guidelines and was at no risk at any time.&quot;</body></row>

<body>From classic to cutting-edge, here's what's hot in the world of dance for January and February.   Mormophes Ballet Troupe  In just two short years, Christopher Wheeldon went from being a New York City Ballet rookie to its first artist-in-residence. Now, scarcely 10 years later, he's the talk of the modern ballet choreography town. Prolific, inventive and forward-thinking, expect to see an exciting new twist to a classic art form. YBCA Novellus Theater, January 23-24, 415-978-2787, $32-$49  SF Ballet's Swan Lake  You can't get more traditional than this—Helgi Tomasson’s full-length Swan Lake featuring Tchaikovsky’s breathtaking score returns for an encore presentation after a sold-out run last year. It's a timeless story of transcendent love, complete with the lavish costumes and scenery you'd expect from the SF Ballet. War Memorial Opera House,  January 23-31, 415-865-2000, $45-$275  Uncovered: The Diary Project  Get ready for the naked truth—literally. Sean Dorsey Dance brings back Uncovered: The Diary Project by popular demand after last year's sold-out runs in San Francisco and New York. Using text from real-life diaries of transgender and queer folks, the show's powerful dances reveal stories that history has tried to keep out of the public sphere. From bathhouse antics to pop idols obsessions and tales of outrageous love, this is a powerful raw performance you won't want to miss.  Dance Mission Theater, February 4-7, 415-273-4633, $15-$20  Ronald K. Brown/Evidence Dance Company: Two-Year-Old Gentlemen Be moved by a performance both modern and tribal. This Brooklyn-based dance company fuses traditional African dance with contemporary movement and spoken word. Two-Year Old Gentlemen pays tribute to rituals passed down from one generation to the next and poses questions about male's responsibility in today's world.

<body>San Francisco's 12th Independent Film Festival kicks off tonight at the Roxie with two screenings of Wah Do Dem, Ben Chace and Sam Fleischner's vérité-style account of a Brooklynite, played by newcomer Sean Bones, on a solo journey of self-discovery in Jamaica. The festival will continue through Thursday, Feb. 18, featuring a diverse collection of disturbing melodramas, locally based comedies and documentaries from abroad. For tickets, click here.1. Easier with PracticeWhere: Roxie Theater, 3117 16th St., 415-863-1087When: Feb. 13, 15Why: Winner of the Grand Jury Prize at CineVegas 2009, Kyle Patrick Alvarez's absorbing drama convincingly illustrates how a chance encounter of the most intimate variety, even over the phone, can lead to fascination and something like love. The relationship that develops between young novelist Davy (Brian Geraghty, of The Hurt Locker) and his sultry mystery caller is fraught with complications and secrecy, but thanks to Alvarez, who based his screenplay on an autobiographical GQ article by Davy Rothbart, their story never hits a false note. The film understands and respects its characters, even when their better judgment escapes them.
2. The Art of the StealWhere: Roxie Theater, 3117 16th St., 415-863-1087 When: Feb. 14, 18 Why: Don Argott (Rock School) asks us to consider the battle raging over the treasures of the Barnes Foundation, and it's an invitation well worth accepting. Founded in 1922 by millionaire art enthusiast Dr. Albert C. Barnes, the Foundation currently boasts a collection of Post-Impressionist and early Modern art worth roughly $25 billion. The only problem? Barnes, whose collection was scorned by the cultural elite of his day, left control of it to a small African-American college, on the condition that the paintings never be exploited for commercial gain. Now, the city of Philadelphia, for one, wants to make them a tourist attraction. Art of the Steal is a thoughtful meditation on public vs. private rights, and, thanks to Argott, fascinating entertainment.
3. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are UndeadWhere: Roxie Theater, 3117 16th St., 415-863-1087 When: Feb. 5, 9 Why: If nothing else, you have to love the title. But the premise of Jordan Galland's cheerfully black comedy, featuring Ralph Macchio, Devon Aoki, Jeremy Sisto and an original score by Sean Lennon, is equally intriguing: A crafty vampire attempts to lure the &quot;real&quot; Hamlet – his onetime apprentice, and a recovered vampire in his own right – out of hiding to settle a centuries-old score. Silly? Yes. Stupid? Possibly. Fun? For sure.
4. Beyond the PoleWhere: Roxie Theater, 3117 16th St., 415-863-1087 When: Feb. 5, 7 Why: Billed as the world's first global-warming comedy, David Williams' mockumentary finds two bumbling eco-warriors (British TV's Stephen Mangan, Rhys Thomas) attempting to become the first carbon-neutral, organic and strictly vegetarian duo to walk to the North Pole. That their endgame has nothing to do with saving the planet never occurs to them – blood, sweat and tears, shed in a hilarious series of misadventures, are their chief contribution to the cause.
5. Last SonWhere: Roxie Theater, 3117 16th St., 415-863-1087 When: Feb. 12, 13 Why: It’s a bird! It’s a plane! It’s… Superman, the subject of the new documentary from Brad Ricca, who looks behind the Man of Steel’s cape to reveal his origins and to shed light on the sad fate of his creators, who sold his rights to a publisher for $130 before getting laid off. Ricca’s passion project – he grew up in Cleveland idolizing Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, the local teenagers who created the first comic superhero – is somewhat dry but impressively detailed, understandably in awe of Superman’s rich history and his continued legacy.
6. Oh My God! It's Harrod Blank!Where: Roxie Theater, 3117 16th St., 415-863-1087When: Feb. 7, 10Why: “He is a great poet,” says a onetime admirer of Berkeley’s Harrod Blank, the aggressively quirky subject of David Silberberg’s new documentary. “Back when I got his first poem, I thought I really did love this guy. But that did...</body></row>

<body>We were guests of the Hotel Monaco in San Francisco on this trip.  I received no other compensation beyond the room, and the hotel did not require that I express a particular point of view.  


Unlike most travelers, we arrived at the Hotel Monaco on foot.  We will rent a car later in the trip, but for our two days in San Francisco, we will use public transportation exclusively.  It's always a bit strange to show up at a nice hotel exhausted, disheveled, and carting all your luggage!

The Hotel Monaco is a few blocks from Union Square in Downtown San Francisco, making it a good launching point for a family adventure in the city.  I have stayed at Monaco and other Kimpton properties in other cities before (at my own expense) and the hotels are usually a bit quirky and kind of fun.  Most have special amenities for travelers with kids and travelers with pets.





  

  



The Hotel Monaco San Francisco was no different.  There were goldfish bowls on the front desk and a dog bowl at the entrance.   from the goldfish on the front desk to the game cabinet where the kids could check out games to bring to our room (they chose Candyland), then we were shown up to our room




  

  
  
    
    
      Double Bed at Hotel Monaco
    
  
  



With two double beds and a crib, the room was a tight squeeze for our family of five, but it was also comfortably appointed - with a nice desk, downy beds and a huge bathroom.
The kids thought the in-room goldfish was extra cute

But mostly they were thrilled with the contents of their gift bags: Crayons, coloring pages, a card game, and bubbles.  We took those bubbles with us to Golden Gate park the next day!




  

  
  
    
    
      Some of the items in the children's gift bag from Hotel Monaco (included were bubbles, crayons, coloring pages, and a card game)
    
  
  



We ventured out to dinner in Chinatown. With the Cable Car line just a few blocks away, this seemed like the perfect time to take a ride.  Needless to say, the kids absolutely loved the ride.  I, on the other hand was terrified - a little jolt would have sent them all  flying.  Here's a shot my husband took of me trying to hodl on to everyone!




  

  
  
    
    
      One Mom, Three Kids and a Steep Hill
    
  
  




Next time we'll be sure to sit inside.

We arrived in Chinatown just as most of the shops were closing up.  That gave us little time to peek in and see what seemed like a totally different world (even compared to the Seattle's flourishing international district).  A seafood shop sold live fish, shellfish, frogs and turtles.  Produce shops sold fruits and vegetables in every imaginable shape and color.  The kids were fascinated, but also tired and hungry. 
Being here with the kids was an odd sensation.  I have my own childhood memories of Chinatown and it's strange sights and smells.  To be here at night was to remember eating bbq duck on the sidewalk while watching the Chinese New Year parade.  The area hasn't changed much, and it was fun to explore, even briefly with the kids.

After dinner we headed back to the hotel where the kids took their first ever shower (our room was tub-less) so that they'd have an excuse to wrap themselves up in these cute kid-sized bathrobes.  The shower was giggly, silly fun - and as often happens, it's this memory (not all the sites we visited) that will stick with me long after this trip is over.

Bedtime sweets are one of my pet-peeves, and when we're not fast enough to spirit the turndown chocolates away before the kids see them, we wrestle over saving them until morning.  E's developing writing skills came in handy this time, and he felt confident that he really would get his chocolate the next day once everyone's treat had their name on it.

<body>The dramatic shifts in terrain, intricate architectural details, monumental landmarks, and culture collisions that make up San Francisco provide endless stimulation for the eyes, and endless inspiration for the artist. This Valentine's Day–or any day, really–show your appreciation for the town you love with a print commemorating our City by the Bay.
New to us:

Relaxing in San Francisco by Matte Stephens (shown) Remember when you could go outside without gearing up in a full rain suit? When weather is on your side, a day in the park can't be beat. Relive that feeling with this cheerful print. (Although those gray clouds do seem slightly foreboding...)
It's an Odd Thing, San Francisco by Katidid Designs Oscar Wilde's famous quote about the black hole-like tendencies of our town gets commemorated in punchy letterpress form.
A San Francisco Print by Sion Lee One of the city's more iconic architectural styles gets twisted, twirled, and turned on its head, then reassembled into a semi-abstract, puzzle-like pattern.

A few favorites:

San Francisco Print by Ork Posters You've no doubt seen Ork's typographic maps detailing the neighborhoods of cities across the US, but it's hard to grow old of the company's simple yet energetic designs. And with new color combos coming out regularly, there's bound to be something (somewhat) new to you.
49 Mile Drive Linocut by 3 Fish Studios If you prefer an homage of a more subtle nature, these prints might do the trick. Citizens of the city will instantly recognize the iconic sign demarcating the scenic drive around town, but out-of-towners may need a little schooling.
San Francisco Print by Lab Partners SF-based design and illustration firm Lab Partners mixes quintessential city imagery with their unique, retro-like charming style. The print is currently sold out at their Etsy shop, but we'd check back just in case.</body></row>

<body>26 year-old Oakland-based designer Amy Sarabi (who was also part of 2008's Hot 20 Class) is killing it on this season of Project Runway. We caught up with the designer to ask her a few questions about her inspirations, aspirations and SF style. Check out her collection here and cheer her on tonight on the show!
What are your plans after Project Runway?Doing Project Runway is like the little mushroom in Mario Kart: It's a boost towards the finish line. I still want to have my own line, a large design studio with in-house sample sewers anda showroom. I want stores in New York and Paris made by experimental architects that are as interesting on the outside as the clothes are on the inside. It would be like a mix of MAC (Modern Appealing Clothing) in San Francisco and the Ann Demeulemeester store in Seoul. I am just a few inches closer to that dream having done the show and gained the exposure.New York fashion v. San Francisco fashion?I think that San Francisco is oozing with unconventional and creative energy. New York is where the business is...and where a lot of great designers work, but the energy is a little bit more restrictive there.Do the words local, organic, green, ethically produced and sustainable have a place in the fashion industry? Absolutely! I think it is open for interpretation...being green doesn't just mean using organic cotton. I think for people who design at my scale, which is neither large enough to buy anything at wholesale but still completely clearing shelves at fabric stores, green means something else. For me, it is about locality. I have good relationships with the fabric stores in the Bay Area like Stone Mountain and Daughter and Piedmont Fabrics in the East Bay and Britex in San Francisco. Keeping it local means less waste and I hope that as I continue to grow I can stay tried and true to the local businesses that have been a part of my growth.What  potentials in the fashion industry do you see for San Francisco designers? I have always said that more than any other city in the United States, San Francisco is the one that can breed an American version of the Antwerp Six from Belgium. I would love nothing more than to be part of a fashion movement coming out of the Bay Area.What parts of San Francisco inspire your work? My boyfriend's father has an interest in herbal medicine. He had done some research on the health benefits of a very particular Chinese root and couldn't seem to find it anywhere as he lives in a small town in Arkansas. He asked me if I could check Chinatown in San Francisco to see if they carry it. As I was walking back to my car one day I see a Chinese herbal medicine shop and step inside. There it was, sitting alongside this bag of what looked like little white chips with burnt edges. These little chips are beautiful and turned out to be dried sea coconut, a small dried fruit that you can throw in soup or tea I believe. That little bag of sea coconuts has inspired a whole collection. From the color, to the shape, to photographed images of it being digitally printed on fabric. After the mushroom, what's your next inspiration? I did a collection after the mushroom collection called &quot;Tying the Knot&quot;, which first found its roots in the wedding dress I did for Lindsey Shook, [7x7's Marketing Director!]. It was based off a technique that I created sculpting around party balloons that were tied in knots. I have a weak spot for small natural things like fruits, vegetables and small flowers. So, as I mentioned above, my current collection is inspired by dried sea coconuts.Favorite local spot?A Cote on College Avenue in Oakland. Their frites and croque monsieur are nothing short of perfection!
What would you be doing if you weren't in fashion?  I think it would be pretty fun to be an Iron Chef!

<body>Time flies when you're having fun, and we sure must have been having a lot of it because January came and went with a blink of an eye. However, February in San Francisco is an exciting time for music lovers. Not only does it signify the beginning of festival season (Noise Pop's pre-party is on 2/18 and they're pumping music nearly every night straight through 3/1), it's also the start of big artists' West Coast legs of their tour. Yay for us! Noise Pop coverage to come, but to warm you up  here's this month's hot list.
 
Mates of State, Café du Nord, 2/1: Obviously this show sold out in minutes, these SF transplants by way of Lawrence, Kansas are veterans in the indie arena (the duo formed officially in 1997 and wed, yes, wed each other in 2001), yet they've never lost their creative charm. Get to Craigslisting to snag a peek at this cutesy couple in the most intimate of venues.
 
Felix Da Housecat, Yoshi's, 2/4: Chicago-bred second-wave house revolutionary captured the scene entirely by surprise with his own recordings, various aliases, and his 90's premiere label, Radikal Fear Records. Still a house and electro staple to this day, FDH still flips fans upside down with his fresh spins.
 
The Thermals, Thao with the Get Down Stay Down, Great American Music Hall, 2/5: Courting their best album to date, The Thermals deliver high energy intelligent punk, showing off their best skills on the live stage. Apparently they discovered the fourth chord in pop-punk, not particularly interesting except to extreme music nerds, but you will appreciate it when you hear it in person. One of our favorite loveable locals, Thao with the Get Down Stay Down, is co-headlining with their edgy folk feel. Definitely a show to get down to (no pun intended).
 
Nouvelle Vague, The Regency Ballroom, 2/7: Seems like the French invasion has officially begun. With Phoenix selling out the Fillmore this week, and Nouvelle Vague popping in the next, we just can't escape all these talented Frenchies (but we're sure not complaining!). Nouvelle Vague's particular claim to fame was, and still is, their beautiful covers of new wave and punk classics. As of late, they've pumped some heavy American country and bluegrass that still stay true to their bold bossa nova ways. You'll fall back in love with classics you never knew you loved in the first place.
 
St. Vincent, Wildbirds &amp; Peacedrums, Great American Music Hall, 2/8: Our favorite Polyphonic Spree soloist, Annie Clark (aka St. Vincent) comes back to visit laying down her complicated compositions and high-energy multi-instrumentalist talent. You'll be blown away by her multi-tasking skills, but when she opens her mouth, you'll fall in love. Opening for her are the up-and-coming Swedish husband-and-wife drum and vocal duo of Wildbirds &amp; Peacedrums. Their latest album The Snake has been praised by Pitchfork (among many others) for their, &quot;application of deceptively simple techniques to create highly complex and agile pop music.&quot; They've already received an award for Swedish Jazz Act of the Year (in 2008), and we won't be surprised when they do it again this year with this presumably dark, but impressive album.
 
The Editors, The Warfield, 2/8: Their brand new album In This Light And On This Evening literally just hit stores a little over a week ago where it debuted at #1 on the UK charts and has been consistently in the top 10 across Europe. Now we know Europe always seems to be a little ahead of the curve when it comes to hit-makers, but here's a rare glimpse into the future. Prepare for The Editors to dominate the US in years to come. Taking on a more electro, synth-heavy and mechanical feel than their previous, The Editors constantly stay on key and manage to create a completely new sound while still maintaining their old identity.
 
Vivian Girls, Bottom of the Hill 2/9: NY-based all girl trio formed a large cult following from their early beginnings playing their home underground scene. After a drummer change and a second album release in late '09, they're touring just as strong as ever.

Isn’t it funny that the photos you tend to zip through are the ones with no people in them, but when you were there man it was a cool shot that you just HAD to capture? Well, we’re giving those photos some love (and context) with our latest mash-in to the Bing Maps Application Gallery. We’ve just rolled out a new application that is currently in a tech preview phase that pulls photos from Flickr®, associates them with Bing Maps Streetside photos and then overlays them by stretching the photo to form fit where in the world it belongs. The new application called Streetside Photos is currently available in Seattle, San Francisco and Vancouver (Canada) - (hello, Olympics!!) to view your Flickr photos in a whole new way.

<body>A few weeks ago, the ladies at Little City Gardens picked some braising greens from their garden for my Mexican Feast at Little Baobab.  The greens were wonderful and grown just a few blocks from where they were cooked and eaten.  They are trying to do what they do best.  GROW.  Yes grow as in plant a seed and watch it grow, but also grow as in growing bigger.  And they could use your help.  Help an Urban Farm Grow! Little City Gardens is a blossoming urban farming business located in the Mission District of San Francisco. Farmers Brooke Budner and Caitlyn Galloway produce an artisinal salad mix, braising mix and culinary herbs, which they sell weekly to a restaurant, and neighborhood subscribers.  As they work, they are developing and analyzing the potential of urban micro-farms to be financially viable within the local market economy.  Little City Gardens seeks to serve a diverse population and to build a community dialogue about food systems, by involving and educating members in their processes and problem-solving.    They are expanding this spring to a larger lot and need your help to raise the funds for start-up capital!

<body>EVEN the most hardcore junkies need variety in their lives. Not every ski resort — no matter how worthy its slopes — is able (or willing) to provide it. We’re as powder-crazed as the next snow-snorter, but what good are great runs if there’s nothing to do at the bottom after dark? 
Mixing things up is the spice of life, and we’ve chosen ten ski towns that have got it all going on — sense of place, preferably a little history, things of this nature. 
Above all, to meet our specifications, the base area has to be supremely walkable. Ideally, the base would be in the actual town (that or the town would be a short hop away via free, regular public transportation). 
Bottom line: Nothing spells annoying quite like shelling out for rental cars (and sitting in traffic) when what you really want to be doing is skiing. Or drinking. Or attending a gallery opening, or shopping, or all the other things you can do in our five favorite towns for 2010. 
ASPEN, COLORADO 
It’s been a wild year for one of the world’s most recognizably fabulous resort towns, from the near-foreclosure of the iconic Hotel Jerome (crisis averted, and just in time for Christmas) to the Sheen-Mueller domestic dust-up. But neither fiscal unpleasantness nor celebudrama can diminish the appeal of this former mining camp turned Skihampton, a compact and appealing town of less than 6,000 that somehow has found room in its heart for Dior, Gucci, Brioni and snowboarders. In high season, a visitor can be excused for feeling a sense of accomplishment; this is essentially winter at its best. Perhaps now even more so, with the economy giving the city a much needed lesson in humility. As a local magazine noted recently: “Sending the kids for sushi with the nanny?” So 2008. This year: “S’mores with dad.”
New and new-ish This year, it’s all about the renovated Little Nell, one of the most desirable on-mountain hotels in the world. Closed early last fall and reopened shortly before Christmas, designer Holly Hunt helped bring the rooms into the 21st century with a sexy new lodge look.

PARK CITY, UTAH 
This quaint ski town in a canyon draws the world’s attention for both excellent powder and the annual Sundance film festival (happening this week). Something you may not know: The town is actually just a fancy suburb of Salt Lake City. No, really — it’s only 15 miles or so out, via I-80. What else does one call a town that’s sprawled all the way out to the interstate, complete with the sort of sparkly lifestyle centers/strip malls that have become a fixture of life in the West over the past decade? This is not to diminish Park City’s appeal, but rather to speak to its accessibility. Most suburbs, though, even ones with Whole Foods and fancy hotels, can’t boast Park City’s skiing — from the convenient Canyons on down, deep into the heart of Deer Valley, Park City’s got it goin’ on. Town-wise, things couldn’t be simpler. You park, you walk up and down Main Street, that’s it — everything’s at your finger tips. With the liquor laws in Utahland loosening up, look for the après scene to become even more fun. Also learn the free shuttle schedule. It could come in handy later.
New and new-ish While it’s unclear what purpose is served by Hilton’s decision to slap the Waldorf-Astoria brand on its new luxury hotel/resort line (strange, seeing as the original is hardly luxurious anymore), there is a certain something about the new Dakota Mountain Lodge at The Canyons. Can you say condo-hotel units? That Whole Foods up the street will come in handy if you decide to make use of the beautiful kitchens. No such pedestrian functionality at the brand-new St. Regis resort (speaking of strange journeys in brand development) in the Deer Crest project, perched above Deer Valley’s Snow Park Lodge and accessed via funicular.

<body>?????The city and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority unveiled plans for an expansive overhaul of First and Second avenues intended to make commuting by bus and bicycle faster and safer. The proposed redesign stretches from Houston Street to 125th Street, and it calls for so-called select protected bike lanes, pedestrian refuges, and the implementation of so-called select bus service and other bus improvements planned to reduce travel times by 20 to 25 percent. 

For the most part, the preliminary plan — which is outlined on StreetsBlog — would put buses on the right side of First and Second avenues in dedicated lanes, either along the curb or next to a lane of parking. Cars would use the middle three lanes and bikes would have their own paths along the left curb, protected from traffic by a parking lane (like the bike lanes on Grand Street and Ninth Avenue). The current plan doesn't call for protected bike lanes on the 10 blocks of First Avenue south of the Queensboro Bridge and 30 blocks of Second Avenue in Midtown where &quot;the traffic levels are the most intense in the entire city&quot; and &quot;[e]very inch of that space is at a premium.&quot; There, bikes will ride in a shared lane with traffic marked with chevron symbols. 

StreetsBlog points out that physically separated bus lanes — &quot;viewed by many transportation planners as the most effective method to improve travel times on highly trafficked streets&quot; — are not included in the plan. &quot;Ideally, the plans would have included some sort of physical separation to protect the bus lane from vehicles that may enter or stop in the lanes, severely compromising the effectiveness of [select bus service] improvements,&quot; notes the blog Upper Green Side, which also has a detailed piece on the proposal. Though the bus lanes won't be physically separated, the NYPD will soon begin &quot;on the spot&quot; ticketing for motorists who enter the bus-only routes, according to the Post.

Construction on the first phase of the project could begin in October, but much of the work on Second Avenue won't begin until construction for the Second Avenue subway is completed, the blogs note.</body></row>

<body>Aphrodisiac: a food, drink or drug that stimulates sexual desire; a thing that causes excitement.

We've all heard of the term, and at one point or another, I'm sure we've all consumed one or several of them. Has it made you hornier or more of a sex machine? The jury's out, but for a different take on the Valentine's Day list of restaurants, here's my top 10 sexual helpers paired up with the places you can find them in New York City. Have fun and best of luck with finding love and some heat this weekend.

10. Asparagus

Asparagus “stirs up lust in man and woman,&quot; wrote a 17th century herbalist. Asparagus is a great source of potassium, fiber, vitamin B6, vitamins A and C, and thiamin and folic acid. Folic acid is known for boosting histamine production necessary for the ability to reach orgasm in both sexes.

You'll find the best asparagus dish in the city at Riposo 72. The sleeper wine bar on the Upper West Side grills its asparagus and wraps them in prosciutto and a thin layer of melted parmesan. It's to die for.

9. Avocado

Like the asparagus, the avocado is rich in folic acid. And just look at it. Its shape alone is sexual. So much so that Catholic priests in Spain once forbade it.

The best way to eat avocado is sliced on a sandwich, in sushi or chopped up in guacamole. For the first, head to Cafe Ronda for their chipotle sandwich with chicken, onions and avocados. For sushi head to BondSt for their salmon avocado roll. You'll find the best guacamole in the city at Mama Mexico on the Upper West Side or at any Rosa Mexicano location. The freshly-made guac is the stuff and both of these Mexican-themed restaurants chop the avocado right in front of you.

8. Bananas

In addition to potassium, bananas contain chelating minerals and the bromeliad enzyme, that are believed to enhance the male libido. Look at your significant other, start pealing one and eat it in front of him or her with a straight face. Have fun with that.

The only bananas I've eaten in this city, excluding the ones for 60 cents at my office cafeteria, have been on pancakes. Head to Norma's for a sick short stack. Their banana-macadamia nut flap jacks with whipped banana and brown sugar butter are off the charts.

7. Foie Gras

I've never been a huge fan of foie gras (or how they treat the ducks in the process), but if you're a Francophile in search of some loving, hit up Bar Boulud. They have an excellent selection of foie gras and pates. Try their country pate foie gras with truffle juice and port. Whether it's the ingredients or the fine food's mystique that grabs you, if eating it makes you feel sexy, go for it. 	

6. Basil 

Smelling basil alone puts me under. Head to Kuma Inn for their steamed edamame with Thai basil-lime oil. If you prefer going the Italian route, head to Gradisca for a couple of options. Not only is this one of my favorite Italian spots in the city, but it's romantic as well and you can try their caprese salad with basil or the cavatelli pasta with tomato, eggplant and basil.

5. Pine Nuts

Pine nuts are high in zinc -- a mineral necessary to maintain male potency.

Kefi has an incredible dish with pine nuts: the sheep's milk dumplings with tomatoes, pine nuts and warm, soft feta. If I could I would eat at Kefi once a week. An alternative to the dumplings would be Frederick's caprese salad with pine nuts sprinkled on top.

4. Chocolate

Chocolate contains chemicals thought to effect neurotransmitters in the brain. The Aztecs once called chocolate the &quot;nourishment of the gods.&quot;

Sfoglia serves an incredible pasta dish with chocolate: its gnocchi with mushroom and chocolate shavings. If you'd rather have chocolate in a sexy dessert, head to Artisanal for their romantic chocolate fondue.

3. Garlic

The &quot;heat&quot; in garlic is said to stir sexual desires.

I eat garlic in just about anything, but one of my favorite dishes in the city is at Esperanto. They serve mussels on the half shell, roasted with garlic, topped with parmesan and paprika. Pair the mussels with one of Esperanto's exceptional Brazilian cocktails and you're sure to ...</body></row>

<body>[UPDATE BELOW] All the single ladies (and whoever), Grammy-award winning Beyoncé Knowles has a new perfume out! Exciting, right? Anyway, in order to get you to buy it, DNA Info reports that she's playing a free show for the people tonight, right in Union Square. But is she? Every other listing has simply stated that &quot;the visionary artist is illuminating the central destination with fiery red light and smoky fog... an unprecedented, spectacular display will vividly capture the spirit of Beyoncé Heat.&quot; That is significantly less exciting. We'll get to the bottom of this, in the meantime, she is having a private launch party tonight at 15 Union Square, where sister Solange will be deejaying; and tomorrow she's making an appearance at Macy's Herald Square at 5 p.m. In any case, if Union Square looks like it's on fire between 6 p.m. and 12 a.m., don't worry, it's just the glow of marketing.

UPDATE: An editor at DNAInfo has told us, &quot;After checking with several of the PR people connected with the event it was unclear whether she would be there... now they are in agreement that she’s not expected to appear at the light show. We’ve updated our story accordingly.&quot;</body></row>

<body>By Willa Paskin		  	February 11, 2010 
	  				 	 			 				When I first moved to New York City, the most surreal moment I experienced was walking into a Cosi in Union Square and realizing that they had a hostess seating people.  It was like being served a gold plated hamburger. Yes, a hamburger covered in tasteless...odorless...delicious gold.  Look, New York, I get it: you feel the need to glam up even the most banal offering.  But some turds do not need polishing!  Yet NYC's obsession with glitzy and unnecessary displays of wealth spins on and the Wall Street Journal has the scoop on the city's latest impressive money sink:  an aquarium in Times Square.  Fine, it does sound cool, but I have a couple of problems with this.
	 	 First of all, New York City already has an aquarium.? It’s called The New York Aquarium.? It exists.


Second of all, let’s just stop and appreciate the incongruity involved in putting an aquarium in the middle of a city that cemented over what was previously among the most vibrant wetland ecosystems in the world.? I mean, that’s just impressively awful.? But, like a scientist said, “don’t worry about destroying the ocean, we will just build a new ocean in the middle of a cement island.”


Third of all, they’re going to put sharks in this aquarium.? Have you learned nothing from Jurassic Park/Deep Blue Sea?!


Fourth of all, they’re not just going to put sharks in the aquarium.? They’re also planning on putting “penguins, otters, and other animals” in the building.? Guys, this is a PR nightmare waiting to happen.? People are cool with corporations exploiting sharks, but penguins and otters?? They are adorable.? Look, I’m going to get a jump start on the protest campaigns.





Are you happy, Times Square Aquarium?? You are bringing this on yourself.

<body>By Averie Timm 		  	February 12, 2010 
	  				 	 			 				Do you remember the first time you drove a car? Broke into your parents’ liquor cabinet? Fell in love?  It’s an overwhelming feeling of adrenaline mixed with anticipation and slight hesitation, all at the same time. The feeling was just the same at this morning’s  Yigal Azruel show, my first venture into the white-tented world of NYC Mercedes Benz Fashion Week.
	 	  (’’)It started off just like any other day- get up, get dressed, get coffee, get to work. Typically, a “usual” day in Manhattan is suddenly off-set by a simple date with destiny- sitting across from Agyness Deyn on the subway, running into Karlie Kloss in Union Square, finding a crinkled twenty-dollar bill in a jeans pocket (later used to pay the month’s electric bill). But today wasn’t just “unusual”, it was straight up magical. Ushered in front of the masses of people waiting for a glimpse of an Olsen or Ronson, I found myself in those majestic white tents fashion devotees dream of. Men and women dressed to the nines in the latest sky-scraping Choos stood defiantly, either pretending to be famous or unrecognizably so. And there I was among them, Chucks, Forever 21 jeans, shirt from Goodwill, and all. I continued through the fashion rubbernecking, keeping an eye out for Tavi and Jane Aldridge just in case other minors had decided to take a walk in Bryant Park. Finally, I was seated. 

	

It’s a peculiar feeling, waiting for a show to start. Cameras are snapping, high-heeled ladies are yapping to their companions who are nearly always gay. Writers settle in, notebooks ready, and then everything goes quiet. The lights dim as the excitement grows. Everyone is waiting for that moment; blinding lights on, music pumping, with the first model stomps in rhythm. For my very first show, this moment came at Yigal Azrouël with a tuxedo-jacketed first look, the model’s sleeves outfitted with solid black fur.




My blurry show shot.


But I had to calm down and take in the finer points of the show. I noticed that Azrouël stayed true to his mastery of draping and refined his Fall 2010 looks with a structured, futuristic flavor. Oversized turtlenecks, asymmetrically cut backs, one-shouldered dresses, and oversized leather and wool ponchos sprinkled the runway for approximately 120 seconds. Just as quickly as it started it was over. The lights returned to their normal state, and I returned to reality. My NYC Fashion Week cherry had been popped, and I couldn’t have been more thrilled.

<body>New Yorkers will be able to enjoy a variety of burgers in 2010 with the opening of a number of burger restaurants in Manhattan.

Elevation Burger, the Virginia-based chain specializing in an organic, grass-fed, free-range burger, has signed a lease for its first location at 103 West 14th Street in Union Square. The 1,900-square-foot restaurant will seat 50 to 60 guests. The restaurant, which will also have an outdoor café, is scheduled to open in May. 

Also in May, Stephen Hanson and B. R. Guest Restaurants’, Bill’s Bar &amp; Burger is scheduled to open in Rockefeller Center. The company has signed a lease for 10,000 square feet of space on the street and concourse levels at 50th and 51st streets, between Fifth and Sixth avenues. The first Bill’s Bar &amp; Burger opened in October 2009 in the Meatpacking District, as The Real Deal reported in &quot;Burger Joints Supersizing&quot; in that month's issue.</body></row>

<body>Feb 3–20Daily @ MoMA The Museum of Modern ArtSpringing up in 1970 UWS as a weekends-only screening room, Film Forum is now the Houston Street mecca for tri-state cinephiles. Its sustained pull and prominence can be traced to Karen Cooper ? the institution's director since 1972 ? and her rarely erring eye for new essentials. As part of MoMA's hat-tip to the Forum's 40th, Cooper curates this 22-program run of nonfiction films that she helped premiere. With complementary short films like Herzog's Guadeloupe-set La Soufri?re, the compelling slate features the well-known and the what's-that; among them are Terry Zwigoff's Crumb, Heddy Honigmann's profile of Parisian buskers The Underground Orchestra, and Bruce Weber's mesmeric look at the talented/tainted Chet Baker, Let's Get Lost.</body></row>

<body>With his new Frequent Flyer Tour underway, which sees him doing his speaking engagements clear through September, his recent stint on the FX show Sons of Anarchy, his collaboration on The Flaming Lips cover of the Pink Floyd classic The Dark Side of the Moon, his recently released book A Mad Dash on his own imprint 2.13.61, you can say that Henry Rollins is a very busy man. But that’s nothing new for him and he seems to like it that way. I had a chance to talk with him about all this and more. How is your new “Frequent Flyer Tour” going? What can people expect to hear about?I am about fourteen shows in so far and all seems to be going well. The audiences have been great and I am glad for a show a night. There are many shows to go, the tour will go until about September if all goes according to plan. I have been talking about the places I have been over the last several months as well as things happening in the news and happening to me. You've been traveling all over the world experiencing things that most people would never do in a lifetime. What is traveling with Henry Rollins like?I usually travel alone. I get up in the morning and usually hit the streets and walk all over the place, looking at things, meeting people, seeing what I can. If I can take the heat, I will stay out for as long as I can. A lot of the time, I go back out at night as well. Quite often, the same streets are very different at night. Where were you when you heard about the earthquake in Haiti and how would you recommend people help?I think I was in Mali when the earthquake hit. I always go to the Red Cross site to donate. How was it working on Sons of Anarchy? Are you sad its over?It was a great time and I gave it my best shot. I am not sad that it's over but I have only fond memories of the whole thing. What are you working on next?I have all these shows to do as well as two books I am working on for a 2011 release. How did you end up working with the Flaming Lips on their remake of The Dark Side of the Moon album?They asked me to and I said sure. I have asked a lot of people to show up on record projects so I try to return the favor when I am asked. Were you impressed with how the album came out? There seems to have been a backlash from Pink Floyd fans over it (See article here) Do you agree with them or are you happy with the facelift the album got?I have not heard the album. I've seen your one man shows several times over the years and I always leave finding out about some amazing obscure music to check out. What are you listening to and recommend these days?I am listening to a lot of releases on the Sublime Frequencies label and the Analog Africa label. It's a lot of recordings from Africa and Southeast Asia. I listen to a lot of releases on the American Tapes label as well. You have a new book out called A Mad Dash. What is it about and how do you find the time to work on so many different projects?The book is travel stories from 2009. I work steadily. I get a lot done that way, like a brick layer, just steadily working away at things. I try not to let things pile up, that way, I can get a lot done without too much stress. Speaking of books, how do you feel about the whole internet revolution and publishing. People seem to be moving more towards reading websites and books on kindle rather than purchasing a physical copy. What's your take on it?I think it will be good for trees and for publishing overall. You can conceivably have a paperless company with no inventory, no storage, etc. That's a huge change in how one works in the publishing world. I have never used a Kindle. I like books but I like the idea of being able to carry a bunch of books with me and not have to actually carry them. Are you going to be coming out with a new album anytime soon and tour with the Rollins band?I have no band, no band plans.Henry Rollins will be performing in NYC on March 12 &amp; 13 at Irving Plaza.

<body>Following news that Goldman Sachs CEOs are getting their bonuses in stock rather than cash this year, Smith &amp; Wollensky has placed an ad in the Times saying that it will award dining credit to customers who bring in NYSE and NASDAQ stock certificates. Obviously it’s a publicity ploy along the lines of the Maloney &amp; Porcelli expense-account generator (Maloney &amp; Porcelli happens to be owned by the same restaurant group), but in this case it’s not just a stunt: Smith &amp; Wollensky actually will accept stock, if you’re looking to unload. But will they get as much publicity out of this as Commerce did out of its credit cards–only policy? Here’s the lawyer’s disclaimer about the trade-in program, followed by the ad.  		

In order to accept this offer, the registered owner of the stock personally must be present and must surrender to Fourth Wall the original stock certificate, plus a separate stock power with a medallion signature guarantee affixed.  The stock must be of a public company traded on a national securities exchange with a readily determinable market value, freely salable by Fourth Wall and free from any transfer or other restrictions.  Market value will be determined by Fourth Wall in its sole determination based on current market quotations, which determination will be binding.  The value of the stock certificate (valued at the prior day’s close) will be credited to their bill.  No credit will be provided if the value of the stock exceeds the amount spent at the restaurant.  Fourth Wall is not acting as a broker or dealer and is acquiring the stock for its own account and not as part of its regular business.

<body>Local busineses are coming together with Brooklyn-based MASAI Marketing to produce &quot;Experience the Heights,&quot; a community event to be held Saturday, February 6 at Five Myles Gallery on St. John's Place. Organizers say &quot;The event will focus on local businesses and talent in the Crown Heights and Prospect Heights neighborhoods. We are highlighting the growth and eclectic aspects of both neighborhoods. Our objective is to help garner additional visibility for the participating businesses.&quot;They've picked a great day for it--February 6th is a First Saturday, which means crowds nearby for the Brooklyn Museum and, hopefully, a little love from the Heart of Brooklyn Shuttle. The event is free and open to the public, and I've copied the text of their flyer below:Wine bars, art galleries, and toy boutiques . . .EXPERIENCE THE HEIGHTSFrom exclusive boutiques selling that one of a kind pieceto friendly cafes where hospitality is common ground.Saturday, February 6, 2010The latest shopping, food, and art in Crown Heights &amp; Prospect Heights.2 p.m. - 4 p.m.Receive 10% off any purchase when you visit the businesses below and mention &quot;Experience the Heights&quot;4 p.m. - 9 p.m.Join us at Five Myles Gallery for a live band performance, works by local artists, wine, and a taste of what the neighborhood's restaurants have to offer.Participating BusinessesThe Breukelen Coffee HouseLily &amp; FigNairobi's KnapsackAwedacityThe Pulp and The BeanBeri OutletGinger Root CafeRawstar Vegan CuisineSit &amp; Wonder</body></row>

<body>There are moments, usually ones having to do with wanting just one good bar or a second good restaurant (here's the first) in my neighborhood, when I?think back fondly on the time I spent living in Brooklyn. Yes, the place in which I?lived came complete with THX-quality domestic disputes broadcast through the wall we shared with the next building; yes, there were critter issues; no, the bathroom was (somehow) not insulated. My nostalgia for it may have something to do with me being 23 when I?lived there, but my eye still often wanders back to BK. So it was a pleasant surprise when I read, in a feature at The Real Deal, that Prospect Heights' Sterling Green and Williamsburg's Mason Fisk, two of the greener and more interesting-sounding Brooklyn developments of recent vintage -- read: real estate crushes -- have been beacons of success in a housing market that's currently pretty flush with beacons of suck. See what I?did there?
I know, it's hilarious, but save your applause for the end of the post, please. While neither Aspen Equities' Sterling Green nor the Meshberg Group's Mason Fisk is pursuing third-party certification as a green building, both are excellent examples of how to develop green real estate in what could emerge as a very big market for green buildings. (I'm talking about Brooklyn, but the broader green real estate market will obviously expand, too) The author of the Real Deal piece above, Candace Taylor, focuses on how Sterling Green's and Mason Fisk's moderate sizes and reasonably priced units helped make them more appealing, with the reasonable size making it easier for developers to clear the financing benchmarks under tightened Fannie Mae condominium financing guidelines and the reasonable prices delivering some very obvious benefits to buyers, especially as the Federal Housing Authority prepares to raise its own standards. From a real estate perspective, then, that both buildings are small (Sterling Green is eight units, Mason Fisk is 26) and comparatively affordable even by the standards of their neighborhoods (condos for sale at Sterling Green average $501 per square foot; Mason Fisk's wound up being $617, when the neighborhood standard was still north of $800) seems savvy. From a green-building perspective, though, both Sterling Green and Mason Fisk offer some interesting lessons.
Stephen covered Sterling Green -- which is over 50 percent sold after nine weeks on the market -- back in March of 2009, and the project was intriguing then for its panoply of green design elements. (Stephen's laundry-list is on the other side of the link above, but suffice to say that it runs the gamut from low-VOC finishes to bamboo flooring to wind-powered common areas) From a design perspective, too, Sterling Green seems exemplary -- its understated look blends in seamlessly with Prospect Heights' townhouses and larger pre-war apartment buildings, making it a good architectural neighbor as well as a solid environmental citizen. Mason Fisk, for its part, stands out as an example of innovative and attractive adaptive reuse in a neighborhood whose other luxury condominium developments -- and I?say this with all due respect -- are generally big glass turds with stupid names. Mason Fisk, beyond doing the usual energy-efficiency things (Energy Star appliances, etc.) stuck with the shell of the hundred-year-old building at 72 Berry Street and made a point of preserving as much of the original structure as possible, down to recycling original wood ceiling beams as furniture for the lobby. Whether either building would make the LEED grade we'll never know, but considering how many macro-developments are currently floundering -- and considering the less-than-green realities inherent in huge new developments in the first place -- it's hard not to applaud two greener-than-average, human-scale, intelligently priced Brooklyn buildings that are making it work in a market that still, by and large, isn't working.

<body>Email Wars - Donna vs. Judy - The Monitor Strikes BackHere is an email from Donna Antonucci who had an email exchange with the the State Fiscal Monitor Judy Tripodi on whether or not the new legistative chnages and the police and fire audits should be factored into the union negotiations. Read below........Read below for the email exchange between myself and Judy Tripodi. I asked Tripodi if we should wait for the outcome of Christie's proposed pension and benefits changes and whether or not we should wait for the audits to advise the contract negotiations. She makes it clear that she has been negotiating these contracts long before Zimmer, Christie and the new Councilmembers were in office. Excuse me, but I think she is basically saying she doesn't care for their input despite that they were elected by the public to represent us.It's pretty clear to me that she is behind the hold up to getting the Police audit from the DCA. Read NJ.com. The new head was hired by? Christie. I wonder what the new Director of the DCA, Lori Grifa, will think of Tripodi's attitude and lack of consideration of will of the people. I conjecture that Tripodi was conspiring with Jacobucci to withhold those audits and I think this email shows her true colors.We need those audits because I have a sinking suspicion that Tripodi's deal is meager at best.What do you think? Think Tripodi said something like, &quot;give me a concession on healthcare (5, 10, 10 - no contributions to premiums, get rid of contract days, keep your terminal pay, keep your ability to accrue vacation towards retirement, keep your unlimited sick time, get 3%+ raises year over year) and I will hide those audits so we can protect you from layoffs?&quot;It is a matter of debate whether or not Christie's proposed changes will trump current contracts. Typically, state statute overrides. I am sure the unions will contest this but it's not a closed matter as she presents it.When she says, &quot;Everyone has known about the police report for a very long time and it was agreed upon by all parties that the report would not have any impact on the negotiations.&quot;, was she talking about Mayor Zimmer and the current Council? It sounds like she is referring to the Roberts/Cammarano administration as if we care what those &quot;corruptocrats&quot; think about what we should do. Roberts was inept and Cammarano is going to prison.After all, they were in when Tripodi got the results of the audit and started the negotiations with Scarinci/Hollenbeck. Who cares if Roberts and Cammarano agreed along with the unions. Nice of her to decide to ignore the results of the audit. How could they not have an impact on the negotiations?What happened to transparency? Is the Fiscal Monitor exempt?Original email from Donna AntonucciFrom: Donna AntonucciSent: Wednesday, February 10, 2010 1:01 PMTo: Judy TripodiSubject: contract questionMs. Tripodi,Given that the state is considering sweeping changes to pension and healthcare benefits for all public employees that are currently expected to go through by the end of February, do you not feel it's prudent to wait for the outcome before pushing through our Police and Fire contracts?I don't know if the bills pass, do they supercede what's in a contract or would the law say &quot;as of the expiration of all contracts the new law will take effect&quot;?For example, if the new law says that all employees must contribute to healthcare premiums up to 1.5% of their incomes and if we signed a contract the day before, would Hoboken preclude itself from taking advantage of the new legislation until these contracts expired? Since we have expired contracts, wouldn't it be prudent to wait for the outcome of this most relevant legislation?Wouldn't it be prudent to wait for the Police audits as well? Would that information advise on whether or not the current deal is a good one or not for Hoboken?Thank you for your time.Donna AntonucciJudy Tripodi's ResponseFrom: Judy TripodiTo: Donna AntonucciSent: Fri, Feb 12, 2010 at 10:05 AMWhat happens in the State has absolutely nothing to do with the City's current contract n...</body></row>

<body>From left: Natavia Lowery and Linda SteinJury selection continued today in the case of Natavia Lowery, the former personal assistant to broker Linda Stein, who is charged with killing the broker-to-the-stars in October 2007.

In Manhattan’s State Supreme Court, 70 potential jurors filed into a courtroom on the 13th floor where Justice Richard Carruthers explained how Stein, who was a top producer for Prudential Douglas Elliman, was “known in the real estate and entertainment world in New York.” Stein, who worked in Elliman’s 980 Madison Avenue office, counted Sting, Madonna and Billy Joel among her clients.

As on Tuesday, which was the most recent day of the trial -- Wednesday was off -- jurors today were then led behind closed doors today to fill out a basic questionnaire and asked if they were available for a two-month trial.

Also likely to be argued today by attorneys for Lowery, 28, who is clad in a gray top and pants in the courtroom, is whether jurors should be allowed to watch a videotaped confession from Lowery, given to police, or merely read its transcript, as defense attorneys prefer.</body></row>

<body>Here are the upcoming NFL playoff games this weekend. Just for fun I added my?predictions?how I think the games will end up.Saturday January 9, 2010Jets at Bengals? 4:30PM ESTStadium: Paul Brown Stadium, Cincinnati, OHNetwork: NBCMy prediction: Jets 27 - Bengals 21Note: The Jets got?several breaks to get into the playoffs but their run game and defense is a recipe for success. They get by the first round. Eagles at Cowboys 8:00PM EST Stadium: Cowboys Stadium, Arlington, TXNetwork: NBCMy Prediction: Eagles 38- Cowboys 28Note: It is very hard to win three games in a row against any team. It is just a hunch but I think the Eagles will finally prevail over Dallas with some explosive plays from DeSean Jackson. Cowboys fans will not be able to blame this one on Jessica Simpson. Sunday January 10, 2010 Baltimore at New England 1PM ESTStadium: Gillette Stadium, Foxboro, MANetwork: CBSMy Prediction: New England 27 - Baltimore 12Note: Tom Brady will be in control of this game even without Wes Welker. Wes is a big loss for sure but there are plenty of adequate targets for Brady without him besides Randy Moss. Green Bay at?Arizona 4:40PM ESTStadium: U of Phoenix Stadium, Glendale, AZNetwork: FOXMy Prediction: Arizona 28 - Green Bay 27Note: A tight game with the edge to Arizona provided Kurt Warner isn't knocked around too much. I could see both teams easily going over 350 passing yards each and this game going down to the wire. Predictions Recap: I have the Jets and Eagles?as the upsets for Saturday and New England and?Arizona taking advantage of homefield in Sunday's games. Home teams go 2-2. ? Send in your predictions below......Hoboken Sports Bars: Texas Arizona, Black Bear, Mc Swiggans, Rogos, Mikie Squared, 10th and Willow, Sullivans are just a few of the places I know of where to watch the games in addtion to being at home. Let me know?if you can think of any others.</body></row>

<body>What fortunate happenstance that Paul Levering from 2pp flew to New York during Restaurant Week! We went to Lure Fish Bar last year and had such a good time. First on our hit list was Tom Colicchio's Craft Bar. We were super early for our reservation, so we sat at the bar for a drink. I had an unassuming bloody mary with a pickled, peeled baby carrot and lemon rind. At first, I wasn't all that impressed but as I drank it the horseradish kicked in. The best slurp was the last quarter of the glass. Paul had the ginger martini. The ginger simple syrup was pretty sweet, but it was good.My first course was a pecorino fondue with acacia honey, hazelnuts and chunks of unmistakable Filone bread from Grandaisy / Sullivan Street Bakery. The idea behind this fondue was clear. The saltiness of hard, aged Pecorino tastes great with drizzled honey and toasted nuts; but the affinage of such a flinty cheese yields high butterfat when it is heated. The fondue had a very messy oil layer and difficult texture to pick up with the bread. Oh, the bread! As much as I love the crunch of the crust, it wasn't sliced into bites. The crust on this particular filone is very crumbly, so I had a messy lap throughout the whole meal. I did enjoy scraping the burnt cheese from the cast iron dish. Paul had a delightful chicken consomme with a poached egg and tortellini. The broth was on the verge of salty, but very pleasing. When you break into the egg, the strings of yolk continue to cook in the soup and adds another layer to the dish as you finish it. I also find delight in micro chives.Paul's main course was orichiette with broccoli rabe, fennel sausage and bell peppers. I really hate bell peppers, so I tried just one bite.My main course was hilarious. It reminded of the time that I went to Wolfgang's steak house and assumed the steak came with a side. I ordered veal ricotta meat balls topped with tomato sauce and fresh thyme-- that is what I got. They were hefty servings! I was only able to eat 1.25 of them. The texture was amazingly delicate and almost spongey due to the ricotta (probably whipped).All in all, our experience was pleasant. On to the next place! Spice Market!</body></row>

<body>[from Flickr, taken by ajagendorf25]We love the Manhattan Bridge, but there's no doubt it's had a rocky history. For one hundred years, it's withstood more than just comparisons to its far more iconic neighbor, the Brooklyn Bridge. Built to relieve pressure on the East River's best known bridge, the Manhattan Bridge went through two different engineers -- and a couple different ambitious designs -- before finally being completed by another architect, who then went on in 1940 to design one of the WORST bridges in America. And serious design flaw afflicts the bridge to this day?Listen in and find something to appreciate in this seriously under appreciated marvel of the East River.You can tune into it below, or download it for FREE from iTunes or other podcasting services.The Bowery Boys: Manhattan Bridge---I mention many bridge engineers in this podcast -- Leffert Lefferts Buck, Gustav Lindenthal and Leon Moisseiff -- but due to time constraints on the show this week, the contributions of Henry Hornbostel were left out. Hornbostel was instrumental in the work with Buck on the Williamsburg Bridge and with Lindenthal on the Queensboro. When we do podcasts on those bridges, he will get his fair due.---Preliminary work on the Manhattan Bridge began in 1901 under Buck, with Lindenthal taking reign of the project a year later. When Moisseiff was brought in to rework the bridge in 1904, construction kicked into high gear. Lindenthal's innovative suggestion to use eyebars was discarded for a more conventional wire structure. [Pics courtesy Life Google images]Stringing the cable across the East River took only four months in 1908. Indeed, the traffic snarls on the Brooklyn Bridge demanded them to work quickly. It was also mayor George McClellan's intention to finish the bridge before he left office. [Photo by GG Bain and cleaned up by Shorpy, see a nifty close-up image here]Gustav Lindenthal, born in Brno (now in the Czech Republic), came to the United States, built many bridges, and dreamt up many more that were never completed, like the North River Bridge, which would have spanned the Hudson River, and a monumental Manhattan Bridge designed with 14 lanes of traffic. The bridge opened on December 31, 1909, although the pedestrian walkways were not completed and no trains were ready to go over it at that time. Setting it apart from its sister bridges was the flat, blue two-dimensional towers. As you can infer from this photo, facing both sides of the bridge were rows of docks and industrial ports. [Pic courtesy NYPL]Berenice Abbott has some spectacular views of the Manhattan Bridge, taken in the 1930s. For crisp, dreamlike pictures of Manhattan, you can't do better than Abbott. [courtesy NYPL]Speaking of Berniece Abbott, Gothamist has some great shots taken by her of the area below the Manhattan Bridge on the Brooklyn side -- today it's DUMBO, known then as the strangely desolate Irishtown. [Flashback: Brooklyn 1936]A day in the life of the Manhattan Bridge, wobbling around due to subway traffic.I also find this video of a bike ride across the Manhattan Bridge to be strangely hypnotic.</body></row>

<body>Not looking likely, at current course and speed      The department said Thursday that a &quot;properly structured&quot; agreement could offer important benefits to society, but it said that Google, the Authors Guild and the Association of American Publishers were still trying to reach too broadly with their proposed class-action settlement.     The revised settlement &quot;suffers from the same core problem as the original agreement: it is an attempt to use the class action mechanism to implement forward-looking business arrangements that go far beyond the dispute ... in this litigation,&quot; the department said.     U.S. District Court Judge Denny Chin in New York, who must decide whether to approve the settlement, is scheduled to hold a Feb. 18 fairness hearing on the agreement.

<body>What better time to be a celebrity in New York than Fashion Week? The HMFIC himself, James Cameron, enjoyed a toast in his honor at Michael’s, though he was momentarily flustered when Dr. Ruth Westheimer presented him with some Sex for Dummies key chains to promote her new book. Designers Zac Posen and Victoria Beckham narrowly avoided a huge faux pas by booking their after-parties at the Gramercy Park Hotel. Luckily Posen picked the Rose Bar downstairs with Russel Simmons and J. Alexander, and Posh received the royal treatment upstairs at the Roof Club &amp; Garden where she and her design team feasted on a meal which included steak, sea bass, and mini red velvet cupcakes, prepared especially for them by Danny Meyer.

<body>Restaurant week was afoot ! Paul and I trudged through the 15 degree weather on a Sunday to the meat-packing district in Manhattan to Spice Market. I recounted a story about the ridiculous outfits that the servers rumored to wear there, akin to the opening scene of Garden State where Zach Braff works in an Asian themed restaurant in Los Angeles. When we walked into Spice Market, both Paul and I exhaled a quiet &quot;Wow.&quot; The interior was Pacific Island-y with palm, bamboo and dark rich reds and oranges. There was a shelf lining the entire restaurant with travel cases and trunks as if we were all passengers on a food train to awesome-town. Even though it was frigid outside, it felt like we could have very well been escaping 90 degree heat.I couldn't take a picture of their outfits, but yes, the servers were wearing thai iced tea colored hospital scrubs. Each member on the floor had a top that corresponded to their job. Runners wore long sleeved shirts while lady servers wore backless, flowy tops and the dude servers wore orange chef coats with high necks. Our opening snack was lentil papadum with a tomato chili paste. We were starving ! They were done in an instant.To quench our morning thirst, Paul got a kumquat mojito and I got a lychee raspberry bellini:The restuarant week menu was kinda small and I was allergic to the chicken curry, so we veered off into the regular menu. Everything is family style and we started with the avocado, radish salad with onion tempura, red wine vinegar, spicy chinese mustard and wasabi powder. My favorite part was the tempura battered onion rings, they weren't scalding hot from the fryer and they had a strangely comforting buttery mouthfeel like avocados. Makes sense!Paul chose the char-grilled chicken with kumquat lemongrass dressing. It was pretty spicy!We also had a side stir fried pencil asparagus, lotus root and lily bulb. The lotus root was really peppery and I couldn't eat too much of it. However, the lily bulb was sooooo nice. Like a very friendly pearl onion that didn't give you dragon breath.I decided to try out the crispy salt and pepper skate with thai basil and lime foam. The servings were HUGE and I could only finish half of one piece ! The texture was striated like crab (not flinty) but held together more like fish. IT was breaded like fish n' chips, reminded me of the haddock at Salt and Battery. I loved the basil lime foam and was dipping the chicken in it, too.Closer look at the inside of the skate:For dessert, we got glasses of Moscato and the exotic fruit salad. Oh maaaaaan, probably my favorite part of the meal. Pieces of kiwi, pineapple, dried cherry and other mysteries floated in a soupy kumquat broth with a scoop of the white pepper ice cream and an oreo-like chocolate disc. The whole thing was spinning ever so slightly in a glass bowl in a bowl of ice. Consider me dazzled.Holy crap, have you been to Spice Market? Did you like it?</body></row>

<body>People are kind of freaking out about this Dolores Park thing, no? The Uptown Almanac broke the news that the park will be closing for a massive $12 million dollar renovation, scheduled to begin as soon as August 2011. Holy hell! That means we're only eighteen months away from a hipster catastrophe of the highest order! And while I'm sorry for the businesses and residents who will have to suffer through the reno (Really. I am. I lived in Boston during the Big Dig, only to move away when it was finally completed.), I think that we can all agree that Dolores Park has seen better days. The poorly irrigated ground is perpetually damp with rain and dog pee (at least, that's what you're hoping it is). The bathrooms? Super-sketchy, but oh-so-necessary when you've spent the entire day drinking beer and rosé in the sun. The tennis courts are falling apart, and there should be a nurse stationed outside the playground to administer preemptive tetnus shots.
Citysearch SF labeled the project a &quot;tragedy,&quot; while SFist published a list of other parks to tide you over during the closure. Judging from the comments, this did very little to quell the hysteria. Friends, we have no choice but to treat the next year and a half at Dolores as though it's our last—at least for a while.</body></row>

Ray's Pizza

27 Prince Street, New York NY 10012 (Elizabeth/Mott; map)
Pizza Style: New York?style
Oven Type: Gas
The Skinny: As classical an example of New York City pizza as you will find. A well-balanced slice with a classic flavor
Price: Plain slices, $2.65; pies, $16 

Ray's Pizza on Prince Street opened it doors in 1959. Although the word &quot;original&quot; does not appear in its name, there is a fairly broad consensus (if not a unanimous one) that it is in fact the first of the numerous Ray-named pizzerias in New York City.

&quot;A Ray's on every corner&quot; is the oft-repeated phrase that reflected the deluge of pizzerias using some permeation of the name Ray?Original Ray's, Famous Original Ray's, World Famous Ray's, Ray Bari, etc.?that sprang up in wake of the success of the Prince street location (henceforth referred to as Ray's for the purpose of this review). The whole business devolved into self-parody as the differing Ray's pizzas (some were chains, others single-store entities) tried to top each other with lawsuits and publicity stunts and by adding more cheese and thicker crusts to their recipes. In my view the last point is the most compelling argument in favor of the Prince Street location's claim. The pizza it sells is primal in its architecture. Whereas the others offer dense crusts with overly sweet sauces and mountains of cheese, the pizza Ray's serves is subtle and sleek by comparison.

Ray's was a barber shop before it was a pizzeria. The tile floor (bottom right) was there when the oven doors swung open in 1959.

Ray's remains a family-owned business. The recipes and the essential way of doing things has been handed down from pie man to pie man and generation to generation. It is an enduring institution in a neighborhood that has changed significantly, especially in the last decade.



The dough, like the sauce, is made in-house. You probably won't see the pie man throwing the dough in the air, a spectacle better suited to creating a theatrical mood than actually making better pizza. The dough releases a fresh, yeasty fragrance as it is worked from a ball into a large flat disk. 



The sauce is mildly sweet but not at the expense of acidity?it adds a pleasing tang to the pie. The cheese is the classic low-moisture mozzarella that defines the typical New York slice. The cheese is added in sparing amounts. 



Ray's gas oven runs at around 550°F; it is not the blast furnace of a coal- or wood-fired oven, and it won't blister and mottle the crust, but it is well suited for the density of the pie.



The crust is crisp, but it has some softness as well. It is a textural contrast that escapes many pizzas in New York, although it can get lost at Ray's on occasion if the slices have been sitting around too long. But fresh from the oven it is a perfectly balanced slice.



The cheese is well suited to the pie, not only by virtue of the creaminess that it imparts but also because it melts so perfectly. Quite unlike the &quot;fresh&quot; mozzarella found at many pizzerias that shrivels into desiccated slivers, the mozzarella here can get blistered while still remaining moist. 



Putting aside the pies sold at the few remaining coal-oven spots like Patsy's in East Harlem and the elevated, fancy cheese combinations made by the likes of Di Fara, I don't think there is an everyday slice more quintessentially New York than the one sold at Ray's Pizza on Prince Street.</body></row>

<body>Smith Streetphoto detailI know you are going to love this!Joe and Marion Alameda of Perfect Corner, the custom picture framing store at 345 Smith Street,  just started selling photographs taken in the Carroll Gardens neighborhood in the 1920's and 30's.  As soon as  they got the photos into their store,  Joe and Marion called me to show them to me.    You see, they know that I love neighborhood history just as much as they do.Amongst the images are incredible shots of Carroll Park and of Smith Street, like the one above, of the corner of Sackett Street.Marion, an avid reader of this blog smiled when she pointed at this particular image.&quot;You see, things haven't changed all that much since that time,&quot; she said, pointing at the dog lifting  his leg against a newsstand in the image.  (She was, of course, referring to a recent post of mine about dogs in Carroll Park.)I agreed. The more things change, the more they stay the same...at least in carroll Gardens.Make sure to stop by Perfect Corner to browse their collection.  You won't regret it.Joe will gladly custom frame one of the wonderful photos for you.  For Home Page, click   Pardon Me For Asking</body></row>

<body>Trudging through the cold wind-whipped rain is worth it once you've arrived at Bar Tano (457 3rd Avenue at 9th Street, 718-499-3400), a warm &amp; cozy respite from the industrial stretch of 3rd Avenue, near the train trestle spanning the Gowanus canal.  They've even got a drink (one among many) called Flats Fixed, a nod to the business across the street, in addition to a good selection of wines and beers.  We settled into a corner table and soaked up the place.  Old tin ceiling and walls, a beautiful wood &amp; etched glass dividing wall between dining area and bar, and low lighting creating a warm amber glow.  Since it was so cold outside, we started with some Butternut Squash soup from the Specials Menu.It was wonderful.  So flavorful and unadulterated.  Just a few drops of olive oil and a small sprinkle of fresh basil.  We also got two Bruschetta to split.  One Baccalá Mantecato (whipped salt cod) and one Fichi (goat cheese &amp; fig spread).The Baccalá was strong and slightly fishy, but grew on me and ended up being a hearty, savory appetizer.  The Fichi was delicious.  The tart creamy goat cheese complemented the subtle sweetness of the fig spread.  We also split a Spinaci e Pinoli salad made with baby spinach, arugula, fennel, dried figs, toasted pine nuts &amp; balsamic reduction.  It was lovely with fresh greens, crunchy fennel and chewy fig tossed in a full-bodied dressing cleansed the palate and got us ready for our pasta entree.We ordered a special Rigatoni with Smoked Mozzarella and Eggplant in a marinara sauce.  The intensity of the smoked cheese was tempered by the earthy eggplant and the sauce was good and simple - not sweet nor complicated.I'm happy to report that Bar Tano lived up to everything good I had heard.  I look forward to my next visit there.</body></row>

<body>Calling all broke boyfriends--here is your chance to make up for that little Valentine's Day snafu: Denver Restaurant Week. Every year, 5280 Magazine offers foodies-on-a-budget the opportunity to sample the haute faire at dozens of leading restaurants in the metro area for the low, low price of $52.80/couple. Even better, this time around there are four Downtown Boulder restaurants participating, and since everyone knows that Boulder cuisine is better, now would be a good time to pick up the phone and make reservations at one of the following hot spots:SALT: New kid in town, chef Bradford Heap is serving up three different courses with choices like homemade buffalo cannelloni or a mahi dish, and a chocolate caramel salt tart to top it off. P.S. You can upgrade with a wine flight for only twenty-five bucks.Black Cat: This European-inspired bistro offers creations based around fresh ingredients from the Black Cat organic farm and root cellar. Think winter root vegetables and warm, savory grain dishes.Jill's at the St. Julien: When the first course on the menu is a beef carpaccio, you can only expect what follows to be at least as equally tantalizing. You won't be disappointed by a menu featuring Colorado-raised proteins served up with a Mediterranean flair.Trattoria on Pearl: Italian, both modern and traditional on this menu--think prosciutto, homemade pasta and delicious sauces to suit every taste. Trattoria also offers an optional wine flight for $15/person.I'm seriously drooling already.The &quot;week&quot; actually started February 20th and goes through March 5th, so you have plenty of time to get in on the action, but don't wait too long or you'll be stuck scheduling a date night on a Wednesday evening at 9 p.m. So come on, go get your fancy on!- Stacy</body></row>

<body>Last week I spent a couple of nights revisiting some old restaurants—I hit A16 on Monday, which is now under the able tutelage of Liza Shaw, and then the following night I went to Town Hall, where I had not been in an embarrasing several years. I have been wanting to return ever since I heard that Vernon Morales had come on board as chef. Morales was the chef at the now shuttered Winterland, where he made waves with cuisine that nodded at his previous training, which includes a five-month stint at El Bulli and time at Restaurant Daniel in New York. Without going into great detail about the the menu of a restaurant that closed in 2008, let's just say that Morales made bacon ice cream well before bacon ice cream swept San Francisco. Following the closure of Winterland, the Nicaragua-born Morales then moved to Dallas, where he was executive chef for Lombardi Family Concepts.
But he's had his eye on returning to San Francisco for quite some time, particularly in order to be closer to his two children, ages 4 and 6. An offer from the Town Hall boys had him packing his bags and relocating. I caught up with the chef, who has behind the stoves at Town Hall since November.
Do you think the Winterland concept was ahead of its time?
Well, I'm not sure it would work now, either, to be honest. The percentage of the population that that type of food attracts is just not represented here. I thought I did job balancing the more innovative stuff with the rest, but I think San Franciscans like things a bit more casual. Although, this city has come a long way in the three years since I left.
How so?
I've just noticed more little places opening where the food is really great. You didn't see that as much before. I love Flour + Water, I love Bar Bambino. That's my neighborhood, so it's nice to see it developing. I think chefs here look to one another for inspiration, and that makes it a great food town.
I think a lot of people were surprised that you ended up at Town Hall. What drew you to that restaurant in particular?
Mitch, Steve and Dough are obsessed with quality and they have pay incredible attention to detail and product. The food is simple but it's delicious.
There are things on the Town Hall menu that can never be taken off—the ham-and-cheese toast, the BBQ shrimp, the fried chicken. In light of that, how do you make it your own?
I like those dishes too! You know the saying, if it's not broken, don't fix it. People love those dishes, so I wouldn't want to take them off the menu just for the sake of doing something new. We're all just getting to know one another, and the team has been hugely supportive of me. I couldn't do another Winterland here, nor would I want to. The food here is good—and I can't touch those dishes because I'd be killed if I tried!
What has been the hardest thing about this position so far?
It is such a busy restaurant. We do 180 covers every night. Every night is like a Friday. It's crazy. But it's all been a process, and an education. I left San Francisco because I had to, but I returned because I wanted to.

Noise Pop week is finally here! Brace yourselves for seven days of indier-than-thou bands, boozy industry mixers and a rockin' film series. And on that note, Noise Pop's film festival kicks off tonight at the Roxie Theater with a sneak preview of Austin, TX: Live Music Capital of the World?.

The rock doc takes a long look at Austin's music culture, interviews local working musicians and discusses the commercial expansion of the city in a post-Bush age economic age. We're pretty sure this subject feels entirely relatable to most music-lovers (or any underground art fan, for that matter). After all, how many of you have slunk into your favorite watering holes and griped over a beer that things just ain't the same as they were before that high rise was built next to your three-story walk up? Frustrating, indeed. 

Austin, TX is the directorial debut of Nathan Christ, an Austin-based writer and photographer. Stick around for the end, where there will be a Q&amp;A with the film's crew. 

What: Noise Pop: Austin, TX: The Music Capitol of the World?
Where: Roxie Theater (3117 16th Street)
When: Wednesday, February 24 (7pm)
How Much: $10</body></row>

If you can't make it in person, you can watch it online on VidSF or right here at Calitics. ?Pretty sweet. ?Anyway, I (Brian) will be there, so it's sure to be a blast. &amp;#xD;Here are some links for your weekend:&amp;#xD;* ?Jerry Brown's office was cleared in wrongdoing in the secret audio tapes made of calls with reporters.&amp;#xD;* ?Tom Berryhill's right-wing opponent, Heidi Fuller, in the senate primary to replace Dave Cogdill, is suing to block Berryhill from the ballot. He's just now moving to the district and Fuller says that doesn't meet a one-year residency requirement. ?Berryhill says that the one year rule is unconstitutional under a Supreme Court case striking down a similar law in Tennessee.&amp;#xD;* ?The Republican primary for the Senate race could be getting really ugly. It seems the Demon Sheep has triggered something between Campbell and Fiorina. Meanwhile, the radio right-wingers John and Ken surprised Carly Fiorina with a call from Chuck DeVore.&amp;#xD;* ?Speaking of Campbell, he's going around proposing a &quot;revenue neutral&quot; carbon tax instead of cap and trade. ?His proposal is to eliminate or restructure the federal payroll tax (FICA) and replace the revenue with the carbon tax. I (Brian) won't argue with him that the carbon tax is more efficient than cap and trade, that much is abundantly clear. However, replacing FICA is a bit more troublesome.</body></row>

<body>Last year when we went to the park to enjoy the annual snow day Satchel and Jiro were both miserable and cold and cried the whole time. I wasn't going to let that happen again, which is why when I saw snow pants in Target in August, I bought them. This year we were ready. Not only did we layer and bundle, we packed a backpack with hot chocolate, five pairs of extra gloves, and even shoved foot warmers in our boots.We ventured out with our sleds, and thanks to the perfectly icy ground, were able to easily pull the boys as we walked to the park. And even the slightest slope in the ground made for a fun ride. We made our way to the Shell, which we thought would be perfect for sledding. There were tons of people there, as well as behind the Brooks. We did some sledding, chatting, and warmed up with some hot chocolate and new gloves. It was hard to tell who was having the most fun--the kids, the parents, or the dogs!After a few runs, we made our way over to the &quot;Bunny Slopes&quot; by the golf course, stopping only for a little dogsledding. Jiro absolutely loved having the dogs pull the sled. He started cheering in what was the cutest moment of the day. It was super slick over by the golf course, making it hard to even walk. It was less crowded, but had some diehard sledders taking advantage of the elevated golf holes. (We even saw a guy on a snowboard!) The multiple falls and the monkeys' fascination with the snow and ice required another glove change and hot chocolate break. Realizing we'd been there for almost two hours, we started our journey home.</body></row>

<body>If memory serves, the City Council appropriated $440,000 for a skatepark last year. (Or it might have been the year before?)

At any rate, last August, the city selected Glenview Park as the site for its first skatepark. 
&quot;We were trying to find a central location,&quot; Mike Flowers with park services said at the time. &quot;Overton Park is full. We just can't cram any more in there. It would have been a great location, but it's full.&quot; 
But it appears that some council members are wary of putting a skatepark in Glenview.

<body>Overton Park Pizze Stone1545 Overton Park725-7806I've reviewed Overton Park Pizze Stone before, but now that they are offering a Kids' Night with a &quot;Make Your Own Pizza&quot; bar, I had to do another write up. First off, let me say that I think it's a great idea. My kids (Satchel, 7, and Jiro, 5) LOVE making their own pizza. They love doing it at home and they love doing it at Lou's. However, at Lou's you have to have a reservation and it's only offered once a month. At Overton Park Pizze Stone, it's every Sunday. And Wednesday. Or maybe just Sunday.I don't live in the Evergreen neighborhood, but I get their emails, which is where I first heard about the Kids' Night. At first it was just Sunday,  but then they added Wednesday. So I took the monkeys on a Wednesday. (December 30th, to be exact.) When we walked in (around 6), there weren't any kids and I didn't see a &quot;Make Your Own Pizza&quot; bar. I asked the waitress about it and she said, &quot;Oh it's only on Sundays.&quot; I explained that the last email I saw said Sunday and Wednesday and she said that they had tried one Wednesday (the one before Christmas Eve) and didn't have a good turnout.Needless to say, we were disappointed. However, I pointed the monkeys' attention to the kids' menu and asked them what kind of pizza they wanted. While they were still deciding between cheese and pepperoni, a man, presumably the manager, came over and apologized for the mix up. I told him that it was fine, but that they ought to give it more than a week, or at least stop changing their minds. He apologized again, and I set about figuring out what I should order. It was at this point that I realized I shouldn't have given the kids the choice of their own mini pizzas and instead ordered a larger one for us to share, but I didn't want to further disappoint them.They both decided on pepperoni and I decided on some sort of turkey wrap with provolone. (I didn't grab a menu and it isn't posted online, so I can't tell you what else was in the wrap. The fact that I can't remember should tell you something. Maybe I got a salad too?) I put our order in with our very sweet waitress and attempted to engage the monkeys in conversation. Maybe I let them each have a notebook. I can't remember! A few minutes later, the man(ager) came out and informed us that the kids could go ahead and make their own pizzas. Yay!At the table next to us they laid out a large marble board, sauce, cheese, and pepperonis. Each monkey was given a ball of dough to roll out and brief instruction on how to do it. I sat beside them and watched as they both every efficiently and effectively created their own mini pepperoni pizza. I'll admit that it seemed a tad anti-climactic. There were only a few other customers in the restaurant and it was very quiet and dark; not at all festive. Everyone was very polite and talkative and encouraging of the monkeys, but it was just a little weird. (In my opinion anyway. The monkeys seemed oblivious to any weirdness.)Actually, the man(ager) was pretty excited about the whole situation and mentioned that he couldn't wait for his kid (who is apparently still in utero) to participate. I smiled and politely mentioned that it might be a while.Since he was feeling chatty, I asked the man(ager) how they did it on Sundays, to get a feel for whether we were experiencing the true Kids' Night. He said that they set up two or three stations around the restaurant and that they let the kids use whatever toppings they want. He also mentioned that on the previous Sunday they had about 5 families. So I could imagine it being a bit more fun and exciting on Sunday. However, I still feel like the inside of the restaurant has a fine dining feel to it, which I guess is fine, but doesn't mesh with the casual menu or the restaurant's seeming desire to cater to families. (They also heavily advertise family sized to go meals.) It just feels stuffy to me. Maybe it's the fact that the inside doesn't really seemed changed from what it was before? (It was previously two different fine dining restaurants.) Like they didn't make it fit ...</body></row>

<body>Yesterday we had our second annual Old Forest Jamboree to benefit Citizens to Preserve Overton Park at the fabulous Hi Tone Cafe. Last year, I thought we made it kid-friendly by having it start at 7pm on a Wednesday. While we did have a few kids in attendance, it was nothing compared to this year! Sunday afternoon from 3-6 (when there is no school on Monday) proved to be way more kid-friendly. In fact, I believe we had more kids in attendance than adults! Which, by the way, is awesome since CPOP's main objective is to preserve the forest for FUTURE generations.The Hi-Tone proved to be the perfect place for the Jamboree. We had a great stage and sound for our musicians, plenty of tables and chairs for our people, lots of room for our kids to run around in, and oh yeah, the best pizza in Memphis, half-price! Thank you, thank you, thank you, Hi Tone!We kicked off the festivities with a round (or two) of Ghost River Beer and the Lorax Posse. The Lorax Posse is a group of forest loving musicians who decided to get together and play some music for the first time ever! Ok, they did have one practice. I thought they sounded awesome and everyone seemed to be enjoying the music. Thanks to Mike Graber, Jana Misener, Krista Wroten, Jeff White, Jim Spake, and Jonathan Hart! Y'all gotta play more gigs!Next up we had the Old Forest monologues. Elaine Blanchard, Roy Barnes, Wendy Sumner Winter, and Steve Black each took the stage and shared their thoughts on our lovely 10,000 year old gem.(Of course only the front room could hear a word they were saying thanks to the two other rooms full of our enthusiastic, dare I say rowdy,  next generation supporters!) Maybe we can get the transcripts up in the next few days.We ended the afternoon with an incredible set from the oh so talented and melodic Star &amp; Micey. People were seriously going crazy over these guys. They are so good! And without really being LOUD. They were just perfect for a rowdy Jamboree. Go see them!It was one of the best Valentine's days I've ever had. Good times with good friends for a good cause. Can't beat that. Thanks to everyone who came out and made it such a success!</body></row>

<body>On Saturday, I went to the Memphis Zoo and stared down the wolves in the Teton Trek exhibit that opened last year. Nice.

On Saturday night, I went to see George Clooney at Malco's Studio on the Square. Nice.

On Sunday, I went to the open house for the new 390-seat Playhouse on the Square, with a backstage rigging area that goes up seven stories and can fly Peter Pan over the audience. Nice.

Later that afternoon, I went to the Central Library, which opened in 2001, then over to Rhodes College, where tuition, room, and board costs $42,000 a year. Very nice.

And on Monday, I read that the owners of Overton Square can't come up with a deal for developing an empty parking lot in the heart of Midtown and have taken their proposed grocery store, demolition, and new buildings off the table.

So much going on in Midtown, so much investment, so much prosperity and potential, so many opinions, and so little going on at Overton Square. What is wrong with this picture? I asked the anchor tenants with money in the game: Jimmy Tashie of Malco's Studio on the Square and George Falls, owner of Paulette's.

Malco built its four-screen boutique theater in Overton Square 10 years ago after taking a pass ? wisely, as it turned out ? on Peabody Place downtown.

&quot;We've been in the square since 2000,&quot; Tashie said. &quot;There was a lot of talk at that time of bringing in all kinds of new stuff. Of course nothing has happened, other than moving Le Chardonnay and Bayou Bar and Grill over to impact our parking.

&quot;When they moved everybody north of Madison, we knew something was going to happen. It's a shame to have that big parking lot with nothing going on. Finding the best use is subject to a lot of interpretation. What Malco wants is something pedestrian-friendly across Madison. We want something open where people feel it is all connected. A view corridor is an important component so people can look between the buildings and see activity on the north side of Madison.

&quot;I have great respect for all the people saying that Midtown must retain its integrity. Whether they can use all the old buildings, I don't know. A lot of them are going to be difficult to deal with. That's a business decision for an investment group to make.

&quot;Cooper-Young has got a little of the spark that Overton Square used to have but no longer has. You don't want a shopping center storefront look there.

&quot;Our theater is doing fine. We've been very happy with it. If they're making the right kind of movies, then our business is healthy. We like having our film festivals and special showings there. The new Playhouse is a great thing. With that, you have live theater, good restaurants, and a movie theater. It just seems like maybe something good is about to happen.&quot;

Paulette's restaurant has been at Overton Square for 35 years.

&quot;I want something over there,&quot; Falls said. &quot;It is terrible not having something across the street. Ever since TGI Friday's went out, it just hasn't been the same. I would rather have something that may not be my first choice than nothing at all. The dream come true would be mixed retail and housing, but that's not going to happen.

&quot;The landlord with Fisher Capital in Denver is a great guy, but he's not a developer. He seems to like the idea of the grocery store, and I'm certainly not opposed to it. They spent a lot of money fixing up the old buildings, but it didn't seem to help. I was disappointed when I heard about them withdrawing their proposal. I would love to see the development go through that these guys have planned.

&quot;The movie theater hasn't been what I think some of the former landlords thought it would be. We were told we would have a 10 percent increase. I said I would take 1 percent. The thing is, a movie usually starts at dinnertime. We are doing okay, not what it was in the boom days, but we're doing all right.&quot;

Tom Lowe is president of Univest, co-owner of Overton Square.

&quot;I think the economic window of opportunity is limited,&quot; he said. &quot;We want to know where the community stands. We don't want to force anything. We're very impress...</body></row>

<body>Painting people is in again, to my great delight, and so I?ve scouted out some interesting places to people-watch this January Gallery Night, which is this Friday, Jan. 15.

I?d recommend checking out Caggio, a relatively new gallery at 918 E. Brady St. The gallery will feature an exhibit of dreamy portraits on wood panel by Michael Coates (see image, right), all of whose subjects seem to be ? curiously ? charismatic, young and beautiful. The opening reception for the show runs Friday from 5 to 10 p.m.

And speaking of lovely portrait subjects, Reginald Baylor's time as the Pfister Hotel's artist in residence will end in March. So now is the time to see his work in his studio at the hotel, at 424 E. Wisconsin Ave., before he departs. Baylor?s figures, many of which are portrayed as canonized icons, take contemporary African-American concepts of beauty and present them to the viewer in an unflinching way.</body></row>

<body>After today's news, nationally 2010 might go down as the year of high-speed rail, but here in Milwaukee it just might be the year of the Park East.  By looking at the economy and listening to all of the talk of doom and gloom one would think this isn't very likely, but it sure seems that momentum is building in the Park East corridor.

First, up of course is The Moderne, which borders the Park East and is scheduled to break ground in February.  This $56 million 30-story high-rise apartment project received city financing in late 2009 and when built out could serve as a catalyst to further development in the corridor. 

Another significant project that appears to be advancing is the first phase of RSC &amp; Associates' Park East Square proposal.  This first phase would include a 120-unit apartment building with 4,000 square feet of retail space.  Recently it received assistance from the Redevelopment Authority of Milwaukee (RACM) which would issue $25 million in revenue bonds to help the project move forward with the intent of breaking ground in late spring.  Although,RSC &amp; Associates have failed to meet ground breaking goals in the past with RACM's assistance it appears this project is likely to move forward.

At a Zoning, Neighborhoods &amp; Development committee meeting in October, 2009 Department of City Development (DCD) Commissioner Rocky Marcoux stated that Mandel Group would be bringing forward the second phase of the North End shortly.  As of yet this hasn't occurred, but with the success of the first phase, combined with Mandel Group finishing up two major projects,Corcoran Lofts and Cambridge Commons, elsewhere in the city this year, they might look to continue their development within the Park East.

The $76 million Eco-Square at Park East proposal by Fair Market Development would build out 400 residential units and 10,000 square feet of retail space in Block 22 of the Park East if it were to move forward this year.  Unfortunately, as there hasn't been any recent news regarding this project it seems like the least likely of the projects to move forward in 2010.

Finally, Rainier Properties II LLC's office and movie theater proposal looks promising as Marcus Corp., has formally committee to the $100 million project.   The potential time line for this project probably will push it beyond 2010, as various approvals, financing, and a likely city fundedTIF will need to be worked out prior to ground breaking.  If it is able to meet those requirements this project could dramatically change downtown Milwaukee for the better.  Because, it is one of the key sites in the Park East corridor, would fulfill the long talked about downtown movie theater need, further extend theRiverwalk, and be a socially diverse meeting place that Milwaukee needs.

Certainly, there will be plenty of land in the corridor to develop post 2010 and only a couple of these projects will actually break ground this year, but with the addition of new density, new entertainment options, and new office space, it might just be that 2010 is remembered as the year of the Park East.</body></row>

<body>My first cousin Frank died this past December, he was only 58 at the time. Some friends of his held a memorial service out in California this past weekend. One of his friends Scott Millare read my story from last month. I was deeply touched that he read it and felt sad that I was not there for the memorial. Frank Cutrona was indeed a &quot;Son of Brooklyn&quot; and grew up not far from Kensington and Windsor Terrace in Sunset Park. Below is the email Scott wrote to me. Ron,My name is Scott  Millare and I worked along side your cousin Frank Cutrona here in Southern California for the Francis Ford Coppola Winery. Although Frank and I worked together for only a year and a half, we became close as he always called me his &quot;Hawaiian Brother&quot;. We always talked about he and I smoking a cigar and drinking a glass of wine on a beach on the Big Island of Hawaii where I grew up, on the north side in a place called Waipio Valley.I wanted to let you know that while googling Frank's name on the web, I came upon your website and the blog that you wrote about your first cousin Frank on 12/13/09. It was an insight to a different side of Frank that a lot of us on the West Coast had not been privy to. It was a great read!I was at the hospital with his daughters while he was still on life support. The girls had this lost look that will be embedded in my mind for a while....We just had a memorial service this past Saturday for Frank. It was a great gathering of family, friends, former Brown Foreman co-workers, past buyers who Frank called on, and other people within the restaurant and wine industry who had come to love and cherish his friendship. It had been storming with floods and high winds the 3 previous days leading up to that Saturday. When I arrived, you could tell it was a special day, because now it was beautiful and sunny and we were right on the water at the Surf &amp; Sand Hotel overlooking the ocean at Laguna Beach. The setting couldn't have been more serene and perfect!Laura, Heather and Sarah had someone else read their prepared speeches for they obviously would've had a tough time conversing. There were about 4 other people who spoke after that. As the last spokesperson was thanking everyone for coming, I hesitated then made my way to the microphone and asked everyone if I could read something to them. I told them I arrived wearing my Hawaiian shirt because Frank would've been pissed if I was wearing anything else. I explained that I was his Hawaiian brother and said a few words in Hawaiian and translated to them..............and then I proceeded to read your blog from that day to give everyone a sense of where Frank came from.  All 3 girls thanked me for reading that for they had no idea I was going to do so. So I just wanted to let you know that you were with us on that day my brother, and all who heard loved your story. We even managed to get everyone smiling when the part came around about you getting very familiar with the grout in the bathroom on the second floor! God bless!Mahalo nui loa,Scott</body></row>

<body>We don't advocate moving out of the Columbia Waterfront neighborhood - in fact, we strongly advocate moving in - but if you must move, consider supporting the locally based moving company Super Movers.  We recently had the opportunity to interview Ariane of the Super Movers about her company,  the moving business, the neighborhood, and related environmental issues. Check out what she had to say below, which is a great read, and seriously consider using them for future moving needs within the neighborhood and beyond.TWOCS:  How did you get started in the moving business?A: Long story. Some other time. But in the winter of 2005 we took a cargo van and started a man with a van service that has since grown into a full fledged licensed and insured moving company, with our own website and a facebook fan page. I never thought I’d be a business owner, let alone the owner of a moving business. But it’s been a big adventure, all things considered.TWOCS:  How long have you been based in the Columbia Waterfront?A: We moved to President Street in the fall of 2004, and started our business in the winter of 2005, so we’ve been here about 5 years now. When we moved here, Columbia Street looked like it had suffered a shelling – it was all potholes and rubble. There were four poultry houses in a three block radius, and prostitutes at the end of Sackett Street. We could park our trucks in the M&amp;T Ice Cream lot, and get fairly inexpensive space on Van Brunt Street. It sounds worse than it was, but the neighborhood reall did change rapidly. 60 Tiffany Place opened in 2006, and then 26 Tiffany went up. The city repaired Columbia Street to make way for Fairway and Ikea, and two of the poultry houses departed.TWOCS:  What are some of the advantages of basing a moving business in our neighborhood?A: This neighborhood, from a transportation perspective, is great for our business. It has easy access to the BQE in both directions; commercial traffic has to use the Manhattan Bridge to get into the city, and we’re fairly close to the bridge. We work with Treasure Island in Red Hook for storage, and its remarkably close to very desirable Brooklyn neighborhoods—much more convenient than the facilities on Second Avenue in Sunset Park or off Flushing near the Navy Yard.TWOCS:  Your website talks about an initiative to be a more sustainable moving company.  Please tell us more about that and how progress has come along on that.A: We’re happy to be able to report that we’re just finalizing a partnership with the Brooklyn Greenway Initiative to donate a sum of money from each move as carbon offsets. The Brooklyn Greenway Initiative will offer our customers a complimentary one year membership that includes invitations to the Greenway’s events. Besides that, we’re active composters, and have made personal commitments to take as much as we possibly can out of the journey to the landfill. We recycle. We avoid petroleum based plastics as much as possible. There’s a widening gyre of garbage twice the size of Texas in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, and it’s full of plastics that get ingested by fish that get ingested by us, and then we end up full of bisphenol-A and dioxin. We switched to compact mercury vapor bulbs in the office. We use unbleached paper that can be put in our compost. More generally, we’re really working to build a thriving business in a small area. When we move people in Cobble Hill or Carroll Gardens or Park Slope, we’re hyper-local. We use less gasoline than if you hired Flat Rate or Moishe’s who come down from the Bronx. We know the neighborhoods, so we’re better at navigating and we don’t get lost. When our estimators go for a site visit, quite often they can walk.We’ve made other commitments, as well, that will take more time to implement. When we add trucks to our fleet, they’ll be diesel trucks that can use B20 biodiesel fuel.

<body>Deadbeat developers citedBy LOIS WEISS, NY PostThe Toy Building owes a pile of back taxes.According to the city's Department of Finance, the building that owes the most in water charges and property taxes this year is Yitzchak Tessler's former Toy Building at 1 W. 24th St. -- aka 1107 Broadway.The stalled condo development has racked up a tab of $3.5 million and holds a Lehman loan for $246 million. The firm's phone number no longer works.Second is Yair Levy's bankrupt Park Columbus at 101 W. 87th St., which owes $1.8 million.Number six is Yeshiva Yar Torah in Little Neck, Queens, which owes $889,139 going back to July 2008. The newly built pre-K to eighth grade school, which has its own tax lot inside a two-unit commercial condo, is a nonprofit and could be exempt from property taxes, but its officials didn't return calls prior to deadline. Finance did not have a record of any tax-exempt status.In total, the top 10 delinquent New York City taxpayers owe $12.9 million in water charges and property taxes.The city is this week sending 90-day notices of lien sale to 24,963 owners who owe a total of $454.3 million. That's down 23 percent from last year.</body></row>

<body>Beleaguered developer Yair Levy suffered another setback Wednesday when a court issued a ruling allowing the lender on Mr. Levy's Park Columbus property on West 87th Street to move forward with its foreclosure proceedings on the 95-unit condo conversion, according to filings.The U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York granted Garrison Special Opportunities Fund, the lender on Park Columbus, “relief from the automatic stay to enforce its security interest” in the building, the filing stated. Last year, Mr. Levy defaulted on his $20 million loan on the project, and the lender sued him. The day before the foreclosure auction was scheduled to take place in September, Mr. Levy petitioned to block the foreclosure and filed for bankruptcy on the building. “The next step will be to renotice the UCC foreclosure sale that was stayed by the filing of the Chapter 11 case,” said Harvey Strickon of the law firm Paul Hastings Janofsky &amp; Walker, which represents Garrison. “Beyond that, nothing has been decided.” “We anticipated this might happen, but regardless, we are still pursuing damage claims against the banks,” said Dan Deutsche, a representative of Mr. Levy's development firm YL Real Estate Developers. A separate lawsuit involving Park Columbus is still pending.In 2005, Mr. Levy purchased the property located at 101 W. 87th St., formerly known as Columbus Green, from Related Cos. for $42.5 million. He had ambitious plans to convert the building into a condo by renovating the units and adding an additional 40,000 square feet for a four-story townhouse, 23 more residential apartments and retail space. But his plans were foiled by the recession. According to the court filing, the property is currently valued at $45.8 million.Today, construction on Park Columbus has stopped and the state attorney general's office required Mr. Levy to abandon the condo offering plan. In his effort to block the foreclosure, Mr. Levy proposed a reorganization of the project. But the court concluded Wednesday that “Garrison has met its burden in proving that the debtor lacks equity in the collateral, and the debtor has failed to meet its burden in proving that there is any likelihood of an effective reorganization.”Mr. Levy, who once served community service for assaulting his erstwhile business partner Kent Swig with an ice bucket, experienced similar problems at two other planned condo conversions in the city—Sheffield57, pegged as the biggest failed condo conversion in city history, and 225 Rector Place. Last summer, Sheffield57 was auction off for $120 million. Mr. Levy, along with partners Mr. Swig and Serge Hoyda, bought Sheffield57 for $418 million in 2005. At his Battery Park City condo conversion at 225 Rector Place, which also faces a possible foreclosure, owners of apartments recently sued Mr. Levy for $100 million in alleged fraud. A ruling on that case is expected any day now, says Marc Held of law firm Lazarowitz &amp; Manganillo, which is representing the Rector Square tenants. Mr. Levy also defaulted on the $165 million mortgage for 225 Rector Place.</body></row>

<body>OH MY GOD! I can not believe what I am hearing (or reading)! Did someone just say that if they bid it out then there will be more noisy garbage trucks driving through the town??? I think the NJ Transit buses make more noise but I guess because a good number of us have or still rely on them that's not an issue huh? Besides, a noisy truck is not a valid reason for the BOE to be held hostage to the VC or vice-versa.The bottom line is this: The Village Counsel AND the Board of Ed are BOTH FULL OF CRAP. The BOE should have NO dependence on the Village's budget and nor should the Village be dependent on the BOE (to provide work for Village employees). Let the BOE bid it out. And let the Village do what they have to. Furthermore, since when has the idea of cutting back on employees in the worst economy since the Great Depression become such taboo? And can someone tell me when did running this town become a God Damn popularity contest? If it means saving money for the taxpayers than it should be done with no remorse.Running this town is serious business, and it should be planned out and executed as such. And as much as it may effect one's life, the truth is that this is nothing personal to those who may be let go, this is business. It was business to the millions of American's who have been let go from their jobs since Sept of 2008 and it's no different now. As soon as emotions intertwine with business is the very instant dumb comments and even dumber decisions are made. Tough times call for tough measures!Now is a better time than ever that someone in Village Taj maHall needs to grow some damn balls and do something that will insulate the taxpayers and it's retail establishments from any additional increases! And again, if it means loud garbage trucks on the road so be it because if that is someone's biggest fear than I will show you someone who thinks elitism in the new black! When in reality, elitism is a sure sign of complete and total ignorance!I can understand and respect the efforts and I know I don't want to see anyone lose their job, but if that's what it takes to slow the death spiral of this town's debts THAN DO IT ALREADY. We don't need to be Nostradamus to know that with a new Governor calling the shots who has already told us to be ready &quot;to feel the pain&quot; it is NOT going to get any better before it get's worse.So to Village Hall and the B.O.E. I say to you: EITHER STEP UP OR STEP THE HELL DOWN because the voters in this Village are sick of these cunning stunts that result in nothing but us tax payers getting screwed yet again! As Thomas Paine wrote in &quot;The Crisis&quot; (how fitting huh?) &quot;The cunning of the fox is just as murderous as the violence of the wolf.&quot;HOOOOLY CRAP!!! AMEN!!!

Commuters take note: check njtransit.com before you travel today. After 2:30 pm, who knows which trains and busses will be running?

Due to low ridership and worsening weather conditions, NJ TRANSIT service will be modified during the afternoon and evening hours today.
 
Customers are advised of the following:
 
    * Rail Service:  Rail service will be reduced after 2:30 p.m.  Some trains will be combined and others will be cancelled.  Customers should expect delays and check njtransit.com before traveling.  Customers who transfer at Secaucus Junction or Newark Penn Station should also check for changes to connecting service.

     * Bus Service:  While every effort will be made to continue operating bus service throughout the state, customers may experience delays, detours or service suspensions on their routes during extreme weather conditions.  Customers are advised to plan accordingly and anticipate disruptions to bus service.

<body>It was standing room only at BrassWorks Gallery's fundraiser for Haiti on Sunday afternoon (Jan. 31), an event which lured an unprecedented crowd of several hundred people and an unexpected $35,000. 

The gallery, at 105 Grove St, had put together 217 works of original art, donated by about 160 local and student artists, each priced at $50. All the proceeds were earmarked for three charity organizations, Partners in Health, Doctors Without Borders and the Red Cross. 

The event opened at 2:00 pm, but getting there shortly after wasn't early enough. There was a line-up of about 15 people waiting to get inside, and all the (normally) ample parking spaces outside the gallery were taken. 

&quot;We have no idea how many people were there, but my guess would be somewhere in the neighborhood of 400,&quot; said Hillary Jaffe Reimnitz, who, together with Mona Brody, Rachel Leibman, Laura Weiner and John Reimnitz, organized the event. &quot;We had an anonymous donor who matched every dollar we raised, so all together we raised $35,000!&quot;</body></row>

<body>Hospitals in South Florida say they continue to accept trauma patients from Haiti despite published reports suggesting that the U.S. military had halted humanitarian missions because of disputes over medical care costs. 

In a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, Gov. Charlie Crist asked the federal government to help defray the costs of the millions of dollars it takes to care for the injured Haitians, according to the New York Times. 

On Wednesday, shortly after that letter was sent, the military stopped flying injured Haitians to Florida, according to CBS4 news partner The Miami Herald. 

Crist had described Florida's hospitals as being &quot;at capacity.&quot; 

The New York Times quoted Maj. James Lowe, the deputy chief of public affairs for the United States, as saying that &quot;the places they were being taken, without being specific, were not willing to continue to receive those patients without a different arrangement being worked out by the government to pay for the care.&quot; 

But the executive dean of clinical affairs at the University of Miami's Miller School of Medicine Dr. William O'Neill disputed that report. 

O'Neill told The Herald Saturday that despite the fact that &quot;there hasn't been a well-defined plan to pay for uninsured people, we are still willing to take people even if we don't know who is going to pay.'' 

He added that UM doctors working in Haiti were told injured patients placed on planes would not be flown to Florida. 

Dr. Barth A. Green at UM's field hospital in Haiti's capital said the situation was dire because &quot;people are dying in Haiti because they can't get out.&quot; 

Early estimates for care provided to 50 patients at Jackson Memorial Hospital's Ryder Trauma range from $50,000 to $100,000, according to Green. 

Now, the hospitals seem to be pointing a critical finger at Crist, while Crist said he never intended for the missions to end. 

Crist issued a statement Saturday addressing the issues brought up in the New York Times article: 

&quot;Last night, between 60 and 80 Haitian orphans arrived at Miami International Airport. Let me be clear -- at no time has Florida closed our doors to those impacted by the earthquake in Haiti. To the contrary, Florida has been at the forefront of the crisis in Haiti -- caring for the injured, reuniting families, comforting those who have been devastated by loss. I am proud of the continued contribution that we are making to open our hearts and lend our hands to those in need. This state remains committed to this effort, knowing that many Floridians are working 20 hour shifts to meet the enormous challenge. We are grateful for the offer of help from other states as our hospitals become filled with those in need. We will need to shoulder this responsibility together in order to ensure that every crucial need is met.&quot;

<body>The U.S. military has halted flights carrying Haitian earthquake victims to the United States because of an apparent cost dispute, though a doctor warned that some injured patients faced imminent death if the flights don't resume.

The evacuations were temporarily suspended Wednesday, said Capt. Kevin Aandahl, spokesman for U.S. Transportation Command. The flights were halted a day after Florida Gov. Charlie Crist asked the federal government to help pay for care.

However, Dr. Barth Green, a doctor involved in the relief effort in Port-au-Prince, warned that his patients needed to get to better hospitals.

&quot;We have 100 critically ill patients who will die in the next day or two if we don't Medevac them,&quot; said Green, chairman of the University of Miami's Global Institute for Community Health and Development.

At a temporary field hospital at Haiti's international airport, set up with donations to Green's institute, two men had already died of tetanus. Doctors said 5-year-old Betina Joseph faced a similar fate within 24 hours unless evacuated to a U.S. hospital where she can be put on a respirator.

The girl &amp;#0x2014; infected with tetanus through a two-inch cut on her thigh &amp;#0x2014; weakly shooed a fly buzzing around her face as her mother caressed her corn rows, apparently unaware that getting the girl out could mean life or death.

&quot;If we can't save her by getting her out right away, we won't save her,&quot; said Dr. David Pitcher, one of 34 surgeons staffing the field hospital.

&quot;If we can't save her by getting her out right away, we won't save her,&quot; said Dr. David Pitcher, one of 34 surgeons staffing the field hospital.

There were some states that would not accept patients who needed care in the U.S., and they could not be transported without a hospital to accept them, Aandahl said.

Aandahl declined to specify which states declined to accept patients, and he referred further questions to a Pentagon press office, where an after-hours answering service could not accept incoming messages Saturday.

Florida officials said Saturday that they were not aware of any hospital in the state refusing to take in the patients. However, in a letter Tuesday to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, the governor said &quot;Florida's health care system is quickly reaching saturation, especially in the area of high level trauma care.&quot;

Crist asked Sebelius to activate the National Disaster Medical System, which is typically used in domestic disasters and pays for victims' care. His letter noted the state's health care system was already stretched by the winter tourism season and annual &quot;snowbird&quot; migration. South Florida hospitals also were preparing for a surge in visitors for the NFL Pro Bowl on Sunday and the Super Bowl next weekend.

While in Tampa on Saturday, Crist said Florida's Department of Children and Families Secretary George Sheldon estimated the state's costs had reached about $7 million.

Poor coordination and limited resources, not medical care costs, drove the governor's request, said John Cherry, spokesman for the state Division of Emergency Management.

&quot;We've made it clear that (the cost) is an issue we'll deal with down the road,&quot; he said.

Health officials say the medical flights landed without any advance notice, and the poor coordination may be keeping some survivors from getting the help they need, Cherry said. He cited the case of a burn victim flown e...</body></row>

This is a silent auction with walk-in bidding to start at $100.

His band, Living Rhythm, of which bassist Obed Jean Louis is Haitian, immediately began preparing weekly events to support the cause.  One of Living Rhythm’s vocalists, “Zulu” Kheswa, was able to personally recommend the Yéle Haiti Foundation, which was founded by her mentor and native Haitian, grammy-award winning artist Wyclef Jean.

<body>George at his 85th birthday party in 1981 [Courtesy Life]Today is the birthday of Nathan &quot;Nattie&quot; Birnbaum, known to classic television audiences and &quot;Oh God!&quot; fanatics as George Burns. Born to Romanian immigrants, Nattie grew up on Rivington Street in the Lower East Side, first at 230 Rivington Street, then at 311 Rivington in his teens. Those addresses no longer exist, replaced by the Masaryk Towers apartments at Columbia Street/Avenue D.&quot;You know, when I look back on those days on Rivington Street it makes me realize how lucky kids are today. They've got organized playgrounds, Little League, field trips ... summer camps where they have swimming pools, basketball courts, baseball diamonds and even a counselor to hand them a Kleenex in case they sneeze. When I was a kid we had none of those things. Our playground was the middle of Rivington Street.&quot;There was never any problem finding someone to play with because the streets were loaded with kids. In our building alone there were sixteen families, and each family had between eight and ten kids.... [T]here were so many of us we'd get mixed up and forget which family we belonged to....We'd all rush up, and my mother would stand there with the door open. When the house was full she'd close it. Sometimes I made it, sometimes I slept in the hall.&quot;[From &quot;Children of the City&quot; by David Nasaw.]Later as a young man, Birnbaum lived at 272 E. 7th Street, already a performer in the vaudeville circuit. Check out Knickerbocker Village for a look at his draft card and more info.</body></row>

<body>One of my favorite buildings in the Cobble Hill area is the old Dudley Memorial Building, also known as the Long Island College Hospital Stanley S. Lamm Institute for Developmental Disabilities.Sadly, the wonderful structure at 110 Amity Street has been empty for a few years now and the boarded up windows are a sad sight.  The building is free standing today, but that was not always the case.  On both Amity Street and the Henry Street side,  the Dudley Memorial building was originally flanked by equally stunning rowhouses.  Formerly, the walls between the adjoining structures were broken down to allow them to be connected.  Those two neighboring buildings were torn down decades ago.You can see the corner of Amity and Henry Street in all its glory on the postcard above. The old Dudley memorial building was designed by Charles Hough,  one of the founding members of the Brooklyn Chapter of the American Institute of Architects.   It was built in 1903 to commemorate Dr. William Dudley, one of the founders of the Long Island College Hospital, which is situated right across the street and served as a nurses' residence.In the 1970's, the Lamm Institute for Developmental Disabilities moved into the building, but was later relocated.  Finally in 2007, the building was sold by Long Island College to developer Time Equities, Inc.  A development  proposal by Time Equities and partner Lucky Boy would have put an addition atop a 1903 building and would have added townhouses on the adjoining vacant land.  Their design was shot down by the Landmarks Preservation Commission.The building as well as the lot on Amity Street are currently back on sale and listed by Corcoran.For Home Page, click   Pardon Me For Asking</body></row>

<body>See this story at BrooklynPaper.com.By Stephen BrownThe Brooklyn PaperRed Hook already has a furniture store and a supermarket — how about some frat houses?

Developer Joe Sitt sent shockwaves through a monthly gathering of real estate executives on Tuesday by sharing news that he hoped to convert his waterfront land between the Ikea superstore and the Fairway supermarket into a student housing complex.

“Ask any university, they’re starving for student housing,” Sitt, the CEO of Thor Equities, told the development big wigs at the Real Estate Roundtable at the Brooklyn Historical Society.

“[It could be] quasi-residential student housing if we can tempt a nearby university.”

The property, which once housed the now-demolished Revere Sugar factory on Beard Street, has been the subject of much speculation since Sitt bought it in 2005.


Last year, Sitt — best known for selling most of his vast Coney Island holdings to the city last year — was considering turning the Red Hook site along Beard Street into a mega-mall complete with a BJs Wholesale Club.

There was also talk of a flea market.

But structural problems with the remaining edifice on the site killed those plans, along with the building itself, Sitt said.

Noting the enormous profitability of the Fairway and the Ikea, as well as the convenience of the nearby water taxi service, Sitt added that he wanted to “best utilize” the property.

He added that the land would have to be re-zoned before Sitt could do anything with it — a potential sticking point, though there are few neighbors to complain about loud parties.

Representatives from NYU, the Pratt Institute, and Long Island University were unable to get back to The Brooklyn Paper before its pop quiz of an online deadline.Comment on this story.</body></row>

Between our starting goaltender and the Supertwins we can't even afford to add anyone else significant.  Any thoughts?M. Gillis, Vancouver, B.C.Mr. Gillis:  First off, go get yourself a 12 pack of Sleeman's and find a nice spot on the couch.  Then pick up your remote control and find the Center Ice channel that the Wild are playing on.    ~EditorDear WPB,Do you think there's any chance I can get Chuck Fletcher drunk at the next GM meetings and get him to take Benoit Pouliot back?B. Gainey, Montreal.B:  I'd give Pouliot another 5 to 6 seasons to develop.  He's clearly got an upside, it just takes half a decade or so to develop.  ~ EditorDear WPB:What an insane blog you've got here.

<body>Notes From Real PeopleA Note from Pastor ShawnDear Members and Friends of DFC,In one of our vehicles we have a GPS navigation system. It is truly an amazing piece of equipment. You simply type in your destination and a voice tells you when and where to turn to get to your destination. It?s a lady?s voice in our car. She always seems very confident as to where she is telling us to go. Even when we miss a turn, she is patient to tell me to turn around at the next available opportunity. (Usually my wife is not that patient when I miss a turn.) Most of the time the GPS navigation system is right but there has been a few times she has said you have arrived at your destination and there was no destination there at all. Yet how wonderful to have this soothing voice in our car to tell us how to get to where we need to go!Wouldn?t it be nice if we had some sort of GPS navigation system for our life? Nice, especially when those perplexing turns in the road suddenly appear in our lives. At those times to have a voice say ?turn around? or ?keep going, your destination is up ahead.? The voice of God is not as discernible as a car?s navigation system. But I believe God will direct our path! Proverbs 3:6 says, ?In all your ways acknowledge Him and He will make your paths straight.? I believe God has plan for everyone?s life. It is up to us to live for Him and to listen to Him as to where He wants us to go. I believe our Godly navigation system is engaged every morning as we say to Him, ?Today is your day God. I surrender to your will. Help me to be a blessing today!? I believe that God honors that kind of commitment and at the end of a day, and the end of a life, we will have followed the path of God for our lives!As we think about following the path that God has for us, I appreciate the support that has been given to the introduction of two morning services. We believe this is what God wants us to do; it?s an opportunity to reach more people for the Kingdom. Please be in prayer for DFC and its ministry to Denver. We want to do all we can to reach more people, those people for whom Christ died!Blessings on you and yours!Pastor Shawn A. SiegfreidBoard PerspectiveBrothers and Sisters in Christ,In 1998 Spencer Johnson released his book Who Moved My Cheese? This story of the way four characters handle changes in their environment struck a chord with readers around the world, selling some 24 million copies. From our earliest meetings with Pastor Shawn, the Church Board has encouraged him to explore ideas he feels are foundational to transforming us into a beacon of hope through the spreading of the Gospel. With the announcement of the plans for a second Sunday morning service at 9:00 a.m. beginning Easter Sunday, I pray each of us will consider how we can support this endeavor to increase our opportunities for people to connect with the Lord.Change can be difficult. We have a tendency to become attached to the familiar and the comfortable. Corrie Ten Boom once said, &quot;Hold everything in your hands lightly, otherwise it hurts when God pries your fingers open.&quot; Even though we're told in Scripture of the futility of seeking security in the things of this life, it seems we spend a good deal of our time longing for just that.? In the end, as Pastor has repeatedly said, it is simply not about us. We are to have no regard for our personal interests. It's not even directly about others. It is about loving first the Lord God with everything in us (Mark 12:30), then allowing the supernatural effect of that to be manifested in love for others (Mark 12:31). When photographing his portrait in 1954, world-renowned photographer Yousuf Karsh asked Albert Schweitzer, &quot;Which is the greatest of the Ten Commandments?&quot; Schweitzer replied, &quot;Christ gave only one commandment and that was love.&quot; Profoundly simple, Schweitzer got it.For more than 45 years, Polly Thompson was both friend and constant companion to Helen Keller. This woman spent her life in personal insignificance so that the brilliance of Helen Keller could be shared with the world. Miss Thompson ca...</body></row>

This is a homegrown Pub Quiz modeled after those in Ireland and the UK.
What is a Pub Quiz? Good question, find out  here. Or read about us in Westword or The Rocky Mountain News.
Read customer reviews on Yelp.com. 
We’re the only pub quiz that has audio questions: &quot;Name that Tune,” and one comprised of soundbites from movies and TV. 
Play in teams of up to six or by yourself if you're some kind of savant.
If you want to play but don’t have a team, come anyway. We can usually get single players recruited onto an existing team. Others have had success wrangling teammates on the Strictly Platonic section of Craigslist.
Winning team gets street cred, bar cash and other prizes depending on the venue. Bonus Questions for free pints are sprinkled throughout the quiz.  
You don’t have to be a trivia God to enjoy the quiz. Since you’re playing on a team, the collective knowledge base makes for more fun, less pressure. It’s not Final friggin Jeopardy.

<body>DENVER - Its an unprecedented move by one of the world?s largest auto makers, and it affects Toyota auto dealerships across the country, including here in Colorado.
                    
                     
                    DENVER - Its an unprecedented move by one of the world?s largest auto makers, and it affects Toyota auto dealerships across the country, including here in Colorado. 
 
On Tuesday, Toyota announced it was suspending all sales in the U.S. of eight recalled models which have had problems with the accelerator sticking. Initially, the problem involved the floor mat depressing the accelerator. Then, it received isolated reports of the gas pedal sticking on its own. 
 
The affected cars include: 
 
1) 2009-2010 RAV 4 
 
2) 2009-2010 Corolla 
 
3) 2009-1020 Matrix 
 
4) 2005-2010 Avalon 
 
5) 2007-2010 Camry 
 
6) 2010 Highlander 
 
7) 2007-2010 Tundra 
 
8) 2007-2010 Sequoia 
 
 Lexus and Scion are not affected. 
 
At Stevinson Toyota in Jefferson County, Colorado, workers were marking which models they could no longer sell Tuesday night. The dealer is still trying to figure out what percentage of their inventory is affected by this unprecedented announcement. 
 
Managers at Stevinson say they haven?t received a single report of the gas pedal sticking from any customer. 
 
Toyota owner Joe Ditirro says he got the recall notice for his 2008 Toyota Tundra that said the floor mat pushed down on the gas pedal. He replaced it himself because he didn?t want the hassle of going to the dealer. But now, he?s worried there could be a mechanical problem. 
 
&quot;I?m going to have to look into it more to find out what?s going on. Because if it?s not just the floor mat, then I?d like to know what it is,&quot; he says. 
 
Tim Jackson with the Colorado Automobile Dealers Association says Toyota is doing the right thing in the way its handling this problem, and in the end, it will provide greater safety for its customers. He says Toyota could have these cars fixed by next week. 
 
This announcement has no affect on the servicing of these Toyota vehicles. So people can bring them in and get fixed.

<body>HAPPY belated 40th birthday, Internet. It’s true — the most revolutionary invention since the automobile is now officially on the brink of its midlife crisis. 
By all appearances, though, Al Gore’s favorite child is looking as if it may weather the storm; with each passing year, the Internet not only becomes a larger part of our lives, it also becomes more sophisticated and classy. (No, really!)
At this point, you’d be crazy to book travel without doing at least a little online research first. Feeling rusty? We’ve got ten great sites to get you going. And the bookmarking starts . . . now.
THE HUMAN TOUCH Airfarewatchdog.com

A site-wide facelift in 2009 made one of our favorites even easier to use. This site eschews algorithms, instead utilizing living, breathing humanoids for its cheap airfare searches. Want to fly from White Plains to Orlando, but don’t like the prices? Sign up for regular fare alerts — they’ll monitor the route for you. In order to make the cut, fares have to actually be good, apply to more than just one seat and remain affordable when things like the route, layovers, taxes and restrictions are thrown into the mix. 
HOTEL KNOW-HOW TripAdvisor.com

While it’s hard to imagine the travel Web without this decade-old site, it’s also hard to accept that it’s already been ten years since the ultimate source for useful, insightful and sometimes just jaw-droppingly funny hotel user reviews first came into our lives. At last count, there are more than 30 million unique opinions to read on the site, the lion’s share focused on hotels. While TripAdvisor spent much of the past year focusing on how to expand their reach, adding a new flight search engine, hotel reviews are still the meat and potatoes -- they remain the primary reason to visit. 
STAY AT HOME FlipKey.com

For years frustratingly unorganized, the vacation rental market has made serious strides towards cleaning up its act, mostly thanks to the Web, where search sites have been popping up like weeds. We’re recommending FlipKey not because it’s necessarily the best site out there — its competitor, HomeAway.com has nearly double the listings, as of this writing — but because of FlipKey’s affiliation with TripAdvisor, which means an emphasis on both user reviews and user-friendliness. Hopefully sites like this one will get more Americans on board with what smart travelers the world over already know: For longer stays, a house always beats a hotel room.
THE GREAT SEARCH Kayak.com

Planning your first visit to Vegas but don’t know where to start looking for prices on air, hotel and car? Don’t be tempted towards one of the big online travel-agent sites; for maximum searchage, you want Kayak, the greatest little aggregator in the world. It’s hard to think of any site that comes close to having the reach that Kayak does, trawling the Web for prices in dark corners you didn’t even know existed. Kayak doesn’t actually sell you anything, but it will connect you to someone who would be happy to. Better still, use the prices you’ve found and go directly to the company in question to see if they’ll match it. 
PROGNOSTICATE! Bing.com/travel

Mactivists/other haters, lay down your arms — Microsoft’s whiz-bang travel portal is an undeniably great research tool for those who like to predict the future. Of airfares, anyway. Utilizing the technology premiered back in 2003 by the much-ballyhooed Farecast, travelers can tinker with Bing’s Price Predictor and Fare Forecasting tools; check out their flexible date search that shows you the cheapest days to fly coming up. Beats doing twenty date searches somewhere else.
SAVE &amp; SOUND DealBase.com

This clearinghouse of hotel deals collects and analyzes bargains from thousands of sources, including newsletters, Web sites, private hotel offers and online travel agencies. It’s pretty much what we do here with our weekly Hot Deals column, but updating 24/7. Also: We don’t have space in the paper for 40,000 deals, like DealBase claims to have on their site right now. The site only focuses on North America and Europe for the moment,...</body></row>

<body>Pearl Paint, the big art supply store on Market between 5th and 6th frequented especially by Academy of Art, Art Institute, and SF Art Institute students, is closing up shop and having a big 75% off sale. It's already pretty well picked over, but if you're in the market for colored pencils, Sharpies, pens, poster board, picture frames, or paint, you'll probably score some excellent deals. We're guessing their lease wasn't renewed as that whole stretch of vacant buildings next to it (the former 7-11, the former Social Security Office, and the former St. Francis Theatres) are slated for demolition to make way for a new shopping center in the next few years (we can't find online evidence of this right now, but there was talk of a developer doing this several years back — how's that for news reporting!). Also, as you can see from the sign above, Blick art supplies will be moving in next door by summer (at 989 Market), having clearly outmaneuvered Pearl in getting a new lease right on the same block.

	Local fashion designers N.I.C.E. Collective are doing a promotional Leather Jacket Hunt, and the winner takes home a very expensive, free leather jacket. Clues are being issued online, and hunters need to follow their Twitter feed, their Facebook page, and the N.I.C.E. Collective Storeroom page in order to piece the puzzle together. (The three clues already issued are &quot;Bring: a flashlight,&quot; &quot;Like this song: 'Higher than the Sun' by Primal Scream,' and &quot;Ask for this: Cocktail, Army Green.&quot;) The jacket hunt ends next week.

<body>There’s no question that connoisseurship is alive and well in the City by the Bay. But this weekend, the ethos usually reserved for locavore food fans, handcrafted cocktailians and urban cyclists extends its reach into the menswear realm for what is, arguably, the first San Francisco event devoted to dapper style.Dubbed Man Up, the three-day pop-up menswear shop organized by the Durable Goods Concern brings gear for guys sourced from an independent, mostly local cadre of retailers and designers to a temporary central Market Street home. “We’re trying to show smaller, lesser-known brands that are doing things right,” says Michael Maher, co-founder of men’s bespoke shirt company Taylor Stitch and one of four Durable Goods Concern founders. That means eco-friendly watches designed in San Francisco and made in Switzerland by Xetum, custom tailored dress shirts from Taylor Stitch, stylish head-toppers by Paul’s Hat Works, denim and apparel from North Beach favorite AB Fits, ties and clips from Pierrepont Hicks, preppy belts by Belted Cow and wearables from Union Made Goods, Room 4 Vintage and Sui Generis, among others. Along with an array of guy-friendly gear, the pop-up shop promises works by 12 or more local artists and special guest appearances by local coffee roasters, food vendors and wine and spirits purveyors scheduled throughout the three-day run.A contest launched today in conjunction with the event will gift one lucky local with a pair of Dope &amp; Drakkar x AB Fits 1198 raw red selvage jeans (retail $220). To enter, go here and sign up for the mailing list. Man Up, 1035 Market St., www.sfmanup.com. Hours: Friday 3-9 pm, Saturday 11 am-7 pm, Sunday 11 am-6 pm.</body></row>

Impressive debut from this punk trio that has only been playing together for about a year. Singer Faith is sweet voiced but snarly, with lyrical highlights that include a hilariously pointed send-up of the kind of guys who want to marry a RealDoll. Sitting solidly at the more melodic, poppy end of the punk spectrum, this is as accessible as punk gets. Highly recommended.

<body>You might not think twice about carrying your purse, talking on your cell phone, or even getting into your car. But in Oakland, you should.At least according to the police department, who put out a two-page pamphlet this week filled with seemingly obvious tips to avoid become a crime statistic.Residents say several of the recommendations are something they already do.&quot;I make sure anything I have in a friend's car, [like] a computer, I do take it out,&quot; said Hope Baker.Oakland driver David Ernst said, while standing near his car, that he doesn't &quot;keep anything in there I would consider valuable. I may probably move them to the trunk.&quot;But after the interview he forgot, and almost walked away until a helpful reporter reminded him to move his valuables.Officers say that is more common than many people would think -- thus the Oakland Police Department is embarking on a new crusade to tell people to be responsible for their own personal safety.&quot;You'd be amazed how many people leave valuables in plain sight,&quot; said Jeff Thomason of the Oakland Police Department.The department is asking the simple question: Do you have a plan?The city says it's no secret Oakland has a crime problem, like many other big cities, and the police department is looking for creative ways to stop it.Is Oakland's crime-prevention brochure a creative solution, stating the obvious, or a copout?

<body>Matt Hall didn’t know why it was happening, but the Bishop Ford senior guard endured one of the worst scoring slumps of his high-school career through three quarters Sunday night. 
“In the shootaround, I was hitting my shots and everything was good, but I don’t know what happened during the first half,” Hall said. “My teammates told me to keep my head in the game and keep shooting and I pulled it out.”
Hall sparked a dramatic fourth-quarter rally as Bishop Ford defeated Kellenberg, 75-69 in overtime, at the John Salvo Invitational at Adelphi University. 
“They showed a lot of resiliency, a lot of heart and a lot of determination,” Bishop Ford coach John Infortunio said. “Kellenberg is tough. They gave us everything we could handle.”
Hall was held to just two points through the first three quarters. His shot wasn’t dropping, he wasn’t getting calls and he wasn’t hustling back on defense. 
“I kept looking for the ref to call fouls, which is bad,” he said. “My body language was bad at the time, but in the fourth quarter and overtime I played better, like I should have.”
Infortunio also didn’t know what Hall’s problem was, but he knew the result. 
“He was terrible,” he said. 
Infortunio sat Hall in the third quarter, giving him a chance to get his mind clear. While that was happening, Kellenberg (6-9) was seizing control of the game and led by eight, 67-59, with 1:12 left in the fourth. 
“I didn’t say anything to him,” Infortunio said. “He knows. We’ve been through enough battles, enough wars that he knows and should know at least that he’s got to work that out in his head. His jump shot was flat, he wasn’t getting a couple of calls here and there and it was taking him out of the game.”
After knocking down two free throws, Hall buried back-to-back 3-pointers in an eight-second span, the second with 36.6 seconds left to pull the Falcons (14-5) to within 69-67. Hall then stole the ball with 24 seconds left and Nick Jones tied the game seven seconds later. Hall nearly sealed the win with a buzzer-beater, but his shot was off the mark. 
“That was my chance to shine and I had to step up my game,” Hall said. 
Hall also scored all six of his team’s points in overtime, including a big foul line jumper with 1:36 left to put the Falcons up for good. 
“Good players do what Matt did in the fourth quarter and in overtime,” Infortunio said. 
While Hall was the story at the end of the game, Kellenberg’s Aaron Stirrup grabbed the headlines through three quarters. The senior guard torched the Falcons for 29 points before fouling out with 20 seconds left in overtime. 
Justyn McMichael had 16 points, carrying the Falcons during Hall’s struggles. Jones had 12 and Eric Kippins and Naquan Ellerbe had 10 points apiece. Equally impressive was Andrew Williams’ defensive work late, as Ford wore the Firebirds down with a relentless press. 
“They missed a lot of jump shots in the fourth quarter and I think that’s because we pressured so much throughout the game,” Infortunio said. “It gets you tired.”
Infortunio said the victory was critical, giving the Falcons the right mentality heading into pivotal league games at St. John’s Prep and Monsignor McClancy this week. 
“I think losing is a contagious thing and if you let yourself do it once, then they start to think we could lose this one, too,” Infortunio said. “I just don’t like that demeanor, that mentality.”

<body>Our only reason for spending hours on Sunday watching the big game or its accompanying ads and pre-shows will be to gorge on gumbo in honor first-time Super Bowl contenders, the New Orleans Saints. Luckily, Urban Tavern near Union Square will be offering free (hopefully decent) gumbo and the nearby Cityhouse at the Parc 55 hotel will have drink specials all day to go with their 42 (!) flat-screen TVs. 		Other Super Bowl-related meals and deals:

• Ryan Farr from 4505 Meats will be spit-roasting a hog at Bloodhound (1145 Folsom) starting at 2 p.m. and we're guessing there'll be drink specials there too. 

• For the gays and their hangers-on, Truck (1900 Folsom) is having a beer bust starting at 3 p.m., and they'll be serving their usual burger-and-fry menu all day.

• The fine folks at Cajun Pacific (4542 Irving) have take-and-bake deals for things like shrimp remoulade, andouille and chicken gumbo, and creole crawfish pasta. See the full menu here, and you can pick up your food Saturday or Sunday. [via Zagat Buzz]

• Down at at Ghirardelli Square, chain seafood restaurant McCormick &amp; Kuleto's is offering 99-cent bar snacks all day to encourage a football-watching crowd (likely this does not include their signature crab cakes). If you want a table in the restaurant to take part in an all-day prize drawing, make a reservation here.

<body>Bigger isn't always better: sure, Andre The Giant could allegedly drink five cases of beer in one sitting, but his heart gave out at 46, and the poor guy could never find a one-shouldered spandex singlet that fit. For a club small enough to already be a VIP room, get into Twelve.

In the former Hed Kandi space, Twelve's way smaller than most South Beach halls of bottle service swagger, but it's still a totally rigged-up club; they've cleared out the middle of the room, tripled the bar's size, and decked the joint with orb-like black &amp; white banquettes, two 6-foot flatscreens for VJs to play with, a lighting system shooting surges of color around the perimeter of the room, and last but not least, two patent leather dancing poles, who're just happy their country invented the very vodka that gets them action. Grown-up drinks're provided by a full bar, leveraged for a craft cocktail list including the En Fuego (tequila/passion fruit/jalapenos), the Orange Bliss (vodka/Grand Marnier/orange slices/honey), the Dimplomatico (dark rum, mint, lime, sugar), and one with Bourbon, muddled strawberries &amp; basil called Strawberry Fields, which'll soothingly croon &quot;let me take you down&quot;. Different nights get different vibes: Tuesdays it's the Black Betty party rocking mash ups by Pirate Stereo, Thursday reps a downtown indie feel with Poplife's Recess (DJ Contra and Mike Deuce), Friday drops house, and Saturdays're &quot;open format&quot; with hip-hop tendencies -- so, they'll be wearing 15 chains and developing fake beefs to boost album sales?

Twelve re-affirms its club-ness via bottle service, which comprises choices like Johnnie Walker Blue &amp; Black, Macallan, Hendrick's, Don Julio Silver, and bubbly like Perrier-Jouet Fleur Blanc de Blanc -- which any doctor'll tell you you'll be shooting if your undies are as tight as Andre's.</body></row>

<body>Man, I come home from a hard day at work and find a gazillion posts in my South Florida RSS reader. But because I'm loyal to the cause, I waded through them my dear readers and came up with a monstrous evening Sift that you better damn well enjoy...A- Eater Miami gathers up the web reviews of Bliss Burger Bistro &amp; Lounge and it's decidedly mixed.B- SFLTV claims that NBC Miami is homophobic because their readers are &quot;sad&quot; about Cindy McCain supporting gay marriage...I don't get it. However, I do agree with them on one thing...The moods feature is a cool idea for a gossip website, not for a “credible” news source.C- Under The Sun posts an audio clip detailing the struggles of Miami Haitians trying desperately to find out what is happening back home.We follow Desille’s story until she finally learns the fate of her family, and we visit an unsung hero: a Creole-language DJ who opened his radio booth to anyone with a scrap of news to share.D- Mango&amp;Lime previews Area 31's Fish + Wine Dinner that is going to be part of the South Beach Wine &amp; Food Festival in February.E- Holy Crap shares old videos of the Liberty City Riots.F- There's a brand new Italian restaurant opening on Las Olas, according to FTL Today. It was a surprise to many when Mark's on Las Olas closed last year. The upscale restaurant was quite popular and had a sold location on Las Olas. Well, the empty space will now be occupied by a new restaurant named SoLita - South of Little Italy. Opening this Friday, the restaurant is said to take the best of old style Italian restaurants and put it into a modern dining experience.G- Miami Beach 411 describes the Miami memorial for an &quot;iconic doorman&quot; by the name of Gilbert Stafford.If you do not know who Gilbert Stafford is - or was - then you clearly did not go out in Miami Beach in the 1990s and early 2000s. For the unaware, Gilbert was THE doorman on the Beach for almost a decade, guarding the velvet ropes with a combination of humor, attitude and compassion that every doorman could take a lesson from. Sadly, Gilbert passed away on New Year’s Day just before his 58th birthday. Three memorials were held in New York, Los Angeles and Miami to celebrate his life. The Miami version was Wednesday night at Mynt.Deucers also has some photos from the event.H- Leave it to My Weston Blog to tell us about a bus service that will start running between Broward and Miami-Dade starting January 25th.I- Eye on Miami travels across the state to give her opinion on the creation of an off-road vehicle park at the Miami-Dade Collier Jetport.By this point, having waited for hours to speak, I had already jettisoned paragraphs like bags from an over-weighted plane. I changed. Now I scribble a few phrases at the last moment. I might not even refer to my notes.What I value as I speak—and I’ve become a connoisseur of this moment—is to look into the eyes of officials I am speaking to, for any sign of life. From the audience, or the view of a television camera, the local commissioners appear to be listening. That is a different matter from hearing.J- Carlos Miller lands a radio interview in Chicago.K- It's over, says Bark Bark Woof Woof. So that's a wrap. Healthcare reform is dead for now, and given the way it looks like the Democrats are going, it's going to 2025 before we get this chance again. And if history is any guide, the Democrats will get slaughtered in the mid-terms in November for being so feckless. And they'll deserve it. They've got an overwhelming majority in Congress and they have the White House with a president with high approval ratings. It was fun until they actually tried to get something done, something that the country has been working towards since 1912 and now they let one special election kill it all.L- Miami-Dade Dems asks the question: Could Florida go the way of Massachusetts?Smart comment to the effect that Floridians, unlike the good people of Massachusetts, know what it's like to be governed by Republicans.

<body>Heading into a brightly lit dressing room armed with merchandise and ready to view yourself from all angles is already enough to elevate the ol' heart rate, but now trying on denim has reached a whole new level of pin-point accuracy.It's called the &quot;Butt Cam,&quot; a new virtual fitting room at Chicago's The Denim Lounge.The device uses mirrors, hi-def cameras and a flat-screen TV to provide a 360-degree view and ensure a flattering jean from every angle.The Butt Cam is the brainchild of Denim Lounge owner Wendi Shelist. After years of helping Windy City clients find the right jeans for their body (she's a mom of two so she's had some firsthand experience with body crises), she realized that sometimes, you want to see how things look for yourself, instead of trusting your derriere to some salesperson you hardly know.The camera provides views from every angle, letting you know if pockets are flattering, if the fit works for your booty and more. More importantly, it shows you what everyone else sees behind your back.For now, the Butt Cam is a Chicago-only phenomenon, but it's a good bet to land in a dressing room near you sometime soon. Yes, it's a slightly scary concept -- especially after we might still be carrying around some extra poundage from the holidays. But wouldn't you rather take the heat in the dressing room than find out later you've been gracing town with an ill-fitting pair of pants?</body></row>

<body>There is so very little to celebrate the last Monday in February. Long weekends behind us for the foreseeable future, the weather still not quite cooperating, caught between winter food and spring food. In other words, I know you don't have plans on February 22, so you should certainly plan to attend EAST MEATS WEST, a collaborative rabbit themed dinner cooked (and hosted) by Bar Tartine chef Chris Kronner and Sean Rembold, chef of Diner in Brooklyn. Meatpaper has spearheaded the collaboration, and this is the second in a series (the first was hosted at Diner back in November). This is truly a once-in-a-long-while happening and promises to be a fun and festive evening. The rabbits for the dinner will be sourced from Devil's Gulch Ranch, owned by the Pasternack's; a portion of the proceeds will go toward the Pasternak’s fund to help the community in Haiti that they serve.
Need further incentive? Here's the menu.
MENU
A Delicious Drink from Christa Manalo of Beretta
A Festive Aperitif from Lance of St. George Distillery
Rabbit Charcuterie rabbit sausage; rabbit en gelee; smoked rabbit loin; toast, pickles and mustard
Shaved Celeriac Salad toasted masa organics almonds
Andante Pecorino Dungeness Crab Salad baby nagoya and white peacock kale; watermelon radishes; chopped soul food farm egg; buttermilk dressing
Breakfast for Dinner  fried tartine brioche; sautéed rabbit livers; “hollandaise sauce”
Rabbit Legs Various Ways  hind leg al mattone; crispy fried fore leg; sweetbread country gravy; little city greens; twice baked parsnips
Secret Desserts from Liz Prueitt of Tartine and Stacie Pierce of Chez Panisse

<body>Your daily pissed-off PSA: San Francisco is full of urban wildlife, and that means coyotes. If you have a cat or a dog, then do everyone a favor and KEEP THEM INDOORS or on-leash. Cats and dogs who roam free are at risk of meeting and getting killed by coyotes. This isn’t just bad for your pets, but bad for the coyotes, too, who get killed when efforts to coexist with them fail. As reported yesterday in the San Francisco Chronicle (and SF Appeal):

A coyote killed a cat early this morning in an unexpected spot, San Francisco’s Russian Hill neighborhood, said the pet’s grieving owner.
Melissa Dunn said her husband let out the couple’s 2-year-old black cat, Ulubulu, at about 5:30 a.m. An hour and a half later, the male cat was found dead in bushes about 15 feet from the front door.
Dunn said she was sure a coyote had killed her cat because her husband and the couple’s gardener spotted the canine.

San Francisco is native territory for coyotes, but when they tangle with us and our furry familiars, residents demand that they get “dealt with.” If stubborn coyotes refuse to leave their territory, the next step is to dispatch people with guns. So for the sake of the coyotes, keep your pets away from wildlife! It’s seriously not that hard.
And if you haven’t already seen it, now is a good time to watch San Francisco: Still Wild at Heart, a 30-minute documentary about urban coyotes and other wildlife in our city.
Photo credit: Daily Coyote—an example of what WON’T happen if your cat meets up with a coyote unless they were raised together as kitten/pup and goddamn interspecies snuggling is so adorable that it’s almost too painful to look at!!!! UGH KILL ME NOW!</body></row>

<body>Not being a straight woman or a gay man, I normally don't have much interest in musical theater, but I got The Wife and me a couple of Loge seats for &quot;Wicked&quot; at the Orpeum last night. Overall, I'd give it like a B+. Couple of good songs, hell of a lot of stage effects, some talented cast. Could stand to lose about 30 minutes somewhere in there - 2 hours and 45 minutes makes for a long Theater Experience, especially when there are 6 grannies from Walnut Creek cackling behind you.More interesting to me is the fact that &quot;Wicked&quot; is clearly a Mission vs. Marina allegory. Now, if you're not familiar, the plot essentially concerns the backstory of the witches in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.&quot; On the one hand, we have Elphaba, our Mission girl, who will grow up (to be labeled by the patriarchy) as the Wicked Witch of the West. She has body art (i.e., she's green) and doesn't get along with her parents. At school, she develops an interest in animal rights and doesn't hang out much with the cool crowd. This should remind you of someone you know by this point.Glinda is pretty much the prototypical Marina girl. She's blonde and rich and not that smart. She makes fun of Elphaba and doesn't think anything of her right up until the time she suddenly discovers that the stuff Elphaba likes (in the musical, magic; in the real world, LCD Soundsystem and ecstasy) is actually really cool.  I will now magically turn Tecate tallboys into Midori sours!!They become friends, but then have a falling-out over a boy (the rich guy who moves here from Manhattan). They both go to see the Wizard (the head of a tech company). He wants to exploit Elphaba's knowledge (a totally killer next-gen Web 2.0 app) but Elphaba wants to keep it real and not sell out. The Wizard goes with Glinda's lamer, but more popular app (Farmville) and Elphaba leaves Oz (the company) and goes to live in the wilderness (enrolls in the Iowa Writer's Workshop).In the end, Elphaba hooks up with the guy and they disappear into the sunset (have kids and move to Burlingame). Glinda takes over the tech company because she can have it all. The Wizard takes a stock buyout and retires to Jackson Hole. Everyone lives happily ever after.Now, if we could just work a Pains of Being Pure at Heart song into the play somewhere.</body></row>

<body>Last night I broke off the crown of a molar by biting into a Conversation Heart candy.  You know the pastel ones with the smeary little all-caps sayings that come in a box for Valentine’s Day?
There was no pain, since Tooth #19 had undergone a root canal a few years back.  Well.  No physical pain.  Just the $1,200 bill which – OOH OUCH – set me thinking I should create my own line of Conversation Hearts for Realtors.  They’d be just the thing to offer as treats at open houses.
As I sat in the chair with my jaw pried open this morning and listened to my beloved dentist talk about the history of San Francisco dentistry in the 1800s, I came up with a few sayings for my candies.
Straightforward:
FOR SALE
PANO VIEW
HUGE LOT
Unfortunate:
LSD PKG
NO YARD
30K PEST
Desperate:
SHRT SALE
MAKE OFFR
BUY ME
Cryptic:
4 U TIC
OWC
NOT NOW
Contractors only:
NEED TLC
TEAR DOWN
NICE FIXR
Questionable:
STUD LOFT
BIG DECK
ON BUSH
Please comment below with your own real-estate sayings.  I need lots of ideas for my new cottage industry.  I just wish I’d read that pretty pink Conversation Heart before I bit into it last night.  I’m pretty sure it said YOUR MSTK.</body></row>

Board of Directors: Next meeting on February 18 at 4:30 PM, town hall style meeting to follow. The NY Senate has confirmed the nominations of Margie Smith, Dr. Grimm and Mike Shinozaki. With these confirmations,  the tenures of H. Patrick Stewart and Charlee Miller are concluded. We thank the outgoing Directors for their service and welcome the new to the Board.  As elsewhere previously reported, Commissioner VanAmerongen resigned as of January 15, so the Executive Deputy of DHCR, Brian Lawlor, a career executive at DHCR and well known to me, as the acting Commissioner of Housing, will be the Chair of RIOC until further notice.2.    Tram:         A.     On schedule for shutdown March 1 (30 Days!!!) and reopening by September 1, 2010. The  plans for crane usage, street closings (including the upper ramp of the Queensboro Bridge), permitted times, traffic control and safety precautions, all as submitted to the Departments of Buildings and Traffic have been reviewed and permits will issue at the time of shutdown.B.    Shuttle bus service to Queens Plaza during morning rush hour is scheduled, starting at 7:30 AM, operating every half hour, departing from the Gristedes loop on the half hour. There will be a pickup loop around Southtown.C.    Exploration of possible ferry service during the morning rush hour continues. Our survey of Tram riders over the last week indicates both price resistance and geographical awkwardness with the half-hourly 7-10 AM 35th Street docking and a bus up 1st Avenue to 57th Street and back down 2nd Avenue. We are not in a position to alter the proposed route. The business plan requires a $4,000 per day expense to be underwritten by RIOC, offset by fare box collections. Therefore, daily breakeven is at 1333 passengers per day at $3 per ride. Our survey results (out of the average Tram ridership of 1100-1200 during 7AM-10AM rush hours, we got approximately 750 responses, about 60% of weekly ridership weighting for daily usage. Of those responding, about 50% would use the ferry if available and of those 75% would be willing to pay an extra $3 (without transfer to the Metrocard system-unfortunately, the MTA will not recognize the ferry as a participant in the Metrocard system and this negative is the most common recurring comment from the survey). So, applying the response percentages to the entire user population (1150 x 50% x 75% x $3, a highly suspect assumption) would leave RIOC, for the anticipated Tram outage of 130 week days, with an approximate $350,000 subsidy.  The Board will have to consider whether this expense is warranted. Meanwhile, the Octagon Developer is talking about underwriting the service from the existing dock at the Octagon. Stay tuned.3.

<body>Image of Breaking News From Media BistroBREAKING NEWS - THIS JUST IN!!!!!! ( I really like saying that).The New York State Senate this afternoon confirmed the nominations of Margie Smith, Michael Shinozaki and Doctor Katherine Grimm to the Roosevelt Island Board of Directors. I Received this message from NY State Senator Jose Serrano's office: ... the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation's (RIOC) board of director nominations have been considered and approved by the New York State Senate.   As you know, the nominations first passed through the Corporations Committee Chaired by Senator Bill Perkins on January 20th, 2010. Today, the nominations were considered and approved by the Senate's Finance Committee Chaired by Senator Carl Kruger.    Being only a few weeks into the 2010 Legislative Season, it is difficult to have items pass through the various committee's let a lone make it to the floor of the Senate. Thanks to the efforts of Senator Serrano to break the senate nomination log jam regarding these appointments, these RIOC Board Nominations were some of a very small number of nominations that were considered and approved by the Senate's Finance Committee, and then sent to the Senate floor the same day for a vote.  This means that the RIOC Board of Directors can now operate with the members who were appointed this past summer.   These members include:‪  -Katherine Grimm -Michael Shinozaki -Margaret Smith‬  Congratulations to the new board members.     Senator Serrano and I look forward to working with you in the coming months...Upon learning of her appointment, Ms. Smith writes:I’m extremely happy that the Senate has approved our nominations.  I believe that the RIOC Board, as it is now constituted, will be much more responsive to the needs of the community.   What we need now is to be sure that everyone’s voice is heard.  I’m anxious to get started working on an outreach program that will provide a quick, simple way for the Board members to get feedback from the community. Congratulations to the new elected and confirmed Roosevelt Island Board of Directors. More on this later.UPDATE 1/27 - Assembly Member Micah Kellner adds: I am proud to congratulate Margie Smith and Michael Shinozaki on their long-awaited confirmation by the State Senate to the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation Board of Directors, as well as Dr. Kathie Grimm on the confirmation of her re-nomination.   Margie, Michael, and Kathie are three of Roosevelt Island’s most talented and dedicated community leaders, and they will be key contributors to a Board that has steadily grown more representative of the island it serves. I have been a consistent advocate for democratizing the RIOC Board, and these confirmations mark another important step forward in that process. I sponsor a bill (A.3953/S.1394) with Senator Jose Serrano, which would reconstitute the RIOC Board so that it is elected rather than appointed. And in 2008, I secured funds for ballot machines so that the Roosevelt Island Residents Association could run their balloting. In that historic election islanders chose Dr. Grimm, along with five other nominees, to represent them on the Board. Margie and Michael were elected last May, in another successful ballot with excellent turnout.  The island’s voters have chosen supremely qualified individuals with a proven commitment to serving their community. It goes to show that democracy really does work: when people are given the opportunity to participate in the governing of their own communities, they take their civic responsibility seriously. RIOC is better off for it, and so are the residents of Roosevelt Island. Unfortunately, the Governor has not always respected the will of Roosevelt Island’s voters, as when he failed to officially nominate two of the winners of the 2008 election. I wrote to the Governor at that time urging the confirmation of all six nominees and I continue to press him to do the right thing. (You can find my May, 2008 letter in the Publications section of this blog.) Islanders deserve nothing less than full democratizati...</body></row>

Mr. Shane updates us on RIOC Board Nominees status, Tram Modernization Changes, FDR Memorial, Green Rooms/Wild Gardens, Re-opening of Sportspark Pool, Roosevelt Island Bridge Helix Ramp problem, artificial surface for Ocatagon Playing Field, temporary Ferry service during Tram outage, Public Purpose Fund process , RIOC 2010 -11 Budget, Blackwell Park, Winter Coat Drive and Public Safety radar gun speed enforcement.Mr. Shane also reports on a meeting with Gristedes in which billionaire supermarket owner John Catsimatidis promised  &quot;improving quality and reducing shelf pricing&quot; as well as advising of a 10% senior citizen discount!January 11, 20101. Board of Directors: Meeting on January 14 at 9:30 AM. No action yet from the NY Senate on the nominations of Margie Smith, Dr. Grimm and Mike Shinozaki, but it is rumored that the Senate Committee has reported the matter out to be acted upon before the end of January. As elsewhere previously reported, Commissioner VanAmerongen has resigned as of January 15, so this will be her last meeting as the Chair. She will be missed.2. Tram: On schedule for shutdown March 1 and reopening by September 1, 2010. Because of the difficulties in isolating costs associated with the mechanical overhaul of the system and its component parts, we have agreed with POMA that it should go ahead with its work and when completed, as indicated by the resumption of service which is the overriding priority, we will take stock of where we are and how much is left in the budget to address aesthetic station improvements. I have had meetings with Community Board 8 to present the plan for crane usage, street closings (including the upper ramp of the Queensboro Bridge), permitted times, traffic control and safety precautions, all as submitted to the Departments of Buildings and Traffic.3. Southpoint:(A) Green Rooms/Wild Gardens: Phase 1 essentially complete. Permitting and RFP for phase 2 nearing final readiness to be performed in the Spring.(B) FDR Memorial: Legal work on NYC Funding and Development agreements continues with the FERI attorneys carrying the load. Construction likely to start in the Spring. State Parks has rescheduled the meeting to determine methodology for future maintenance for January 29. A $2 million endowment has been received by State Parks. The Governor’s Budget, to be announced next week, will contain the re-appropriation of $4 Million of State funds.4. Projects:(A) Sportspark pool is reopened and fully operational, ADA and code compliant. The gym floor is refinished and bleachers installed. Planning for mechanical system replacement, new weightlifting equipment and other refurbishing is ongoing. The Youth Center will have greater access for basketball and soccer and adult leagues will have a place when the weather makes outdoor courts unplayable. The table tennis group is ever expanding. Watch for program announcements. The many programs available to the residents should make Sportspark a true community center.(B) The status of the helix leading to the Island from the Bridge is being studied. Last repaired more than 20 years ago, an engineering inspection is being done to determine the condition and to program needed repairs. Long term wear and tear, with corrosion from salt in the wintertime, has taken its toll. Hopefully, there will not need to be complete rebuilding, with the attendant dislocation and cost, but the safety of the Island’s connection must be assured.(C) Octagon Soccer Field resurfacing: We have met with the two lowest responsible bidders from the earlier RFP to reconfigure the present requirements in consideration of budget imperatives. With a nylon surface currently in use by the NYC Parks Department, utilizing existing light stanchions (plus one), new lighting fixtures and appropriate drainage and foundation, appears likely to come in within projected capital budget. Project can begin, hopefully, by February and completed four months later. Added by vote of the Ope...</body></row>

Thursday, February 11th.  This rule is in effect to allow for the passage of emergency vehicles and snow removal.Although we did not get any of the predicted snow last week on Roosevelt Island, tomorrow will probably be the real thing. According to Weather Channel:  ...Many areas will likely see over a foot of new snow, including the Philadelphia and New York metro areas as well as in some locations in the Appalachians...Be Prepared!UPDATE 7:20 PM: In addition to the no parking rules and regulations which are in effect for 2/9/10 - 2/11/10, please be aware if you are unloading groceries, etc. to put your hazard lights (blinkers) on so Public Safety will know you are not parking illegally.

<body>Roosevelt Island Tram — famous for its “Spider-Man” movie cameo as well as stranding real-life riders over the East River in 2006 — is on schedule to shut down March 1 through Aug. 31 for a major modernization project.
This past weekend, the Roosevelt Islander blog reported the oft-delayed project is almost ready to begin. The tram is “on schedule for March 1 shutdown,” Roosevelt Island Operating Corporaton President Steve Shane states in a report to island residents reprinted on the blog.
Buses, subways and the Roosevelt Island Bridge will still offer access to the island, which is home to businesses, residences, an abandoned small pox hospital, a lighthouse that dates to 1872, and was the site of a jail that once housed  Mae West as well as New York City Mayor William “Boss” Tweed.
The tram runs between Roosevelt Island and Manhattan adjacent to the 59th Street/Queensboro Bridge. The fare is the same as regular ride on an MTA bus or subway, currently $2.25. MetroCards are accepted.

<body>For as long as I can remember, my parents and I (and sister) have had fondue after News Year's Day. .  It is always a good time as we celebrate another year together!  It was a pleasant surprise to see a food column in the Inquirer focused on fondue.  Read here.My parents have always certainly kept their hippie roots alive ( we also traveled the US for over a month in a VW van).  Fondue is one of those traditions.  We have a simple menu of quality steak and hot dog.  We have also had chorizo, sausage, kielbasa, etc.  We now have two fondue pots - one is oil and the other is a wine broth.  My mom makes a few rice dishes (a favorite of mine), breadsticks, salad and a range of sauces for dipping (butter, thousand island, sour cream).  Add in a lot of wine, loud conversation, laughs, etc. and you have yourself a New Year's fondue!  Oddly, I love cheese and we have not had a cheese fondue at the New Year's celebration.  next year.I encourage everyone to try fondue on your own (not just at the Melting Pot) and start your own tradition around it.  Food is best enjoyed with family, drink and tradition.</body></row>

<body>This is breaking news: Dawn Zimmer has?sent out this press release calling for the suspension of Lt. Anngelo Andriani of the Hoboken Police Department pending an Internal Affairs investigation about a recent incident on January 18, 2010 regarding a &quot;passenger casuing disturbance&quot; issue at Tampa International Airport. This is a seperate issue from the ongoing SWAT team investigation.....Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer Calls For Suspension Without Pay of Hoboken Police LieutenantCity of Hoboken, January 27, 2010 – Mayor Dawn Zimmer is calling for the suspension without pay of Lieutenant Angelo Andriani of the Hoboken Police Department pending a Hoboken Police Department Internal Affairs Bureau investigation resulting from an incident involving Lt. Andriani with the Tampa International Airport Police Department. The incident occurred on the morning of Monday, January 18th in which Lt. Andriani was involved in a “passenger causing disturbance” according to TSA Supervisor Taylor Johnson. “Lt. Andriani must be suspended without pay pending the IA investigation,” Mayor Zimmer said. “This type of behavior can not and will not be tolerated and we are taking swift and decisive measures to remedy the actions of this individual.”Lt. Andriani is currently suspended (with pay) by the City of Hoboken as the result of an alleged incident which occurred approximately two years ago. The incident at the Tampa International Airport is being investigated separately as a violation of administrative policies related to Lt. Andriani’s current suspension. In light of the recent incident, Mayor Zimmer is also calling on all parties to expedite the process involving the outstanding investigation involving Lt. Andriani. The alleged incident involved the Hoboken SWAT team which was subsequently disbanded. Mayor Zimmer has been and continues to demand a resolution to the outstanding SWAT team investigation. The public has waited long enough for a resolution of this case.Here is a great story on Hoboken Now that gives extensive background on the case:http://www.nj.com/hobokennow/index.ssf/2010/01/ex-team_commander_in_hoboken_s.htmlHere is a video of Lt. Andriani displaying not the most professional behavior as a police officer (courtesy of NJ.com's Hoboken Now): Hoboken SWAT team scandalAnd as if this guy was not embarassing enough, here is a video of Lt. Andriani and his visit to Hooters from FOX News in 2008 as well as a lawsuit and other examples of alleged &quot;white supremacist behaviors&quot;:</body></row>

<body>Atlantic Yards Report  


  There's yet another reason not to trust the report (dated August 31) that KPMG delivered to the Empire State Development Corporation on the housing market in Brooklyn.
  
  Remember, the report claimed that Richard Meier's On Prospect Park was 75% sold. However the New York Times reported September 27 that the developer asserted that half of the units had been sold and the web site StreetEasy.com documented only 25 closings.
  
  KPMG also claimed that the Oro Condos in Downtown Brooklyn were 75% sold. That didn't ring right.
  
  In September, Crain's reported that prices at Oro had been slashed 25%. And yesterday the New York Times reported that the building is 44 percent sold. 
  
  Why does this matter?
  
  Because the ESDC relied on the &quot;expert&quot; KPMG to validate its dubious estimate that the Atlantic Yards housing could be absorbed in a decade, a crucial defense in the case challenging the ESDC's approval of the 2009 Modified General Project Plan and the failure to issue a Supplementary Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS).
  
  The information on Oro further undermines KPMG's expertise.

<body>I wanted to try and locate at least 100 species in Brooklyn before the end of January. It seems like a lot, especially considering that I saw 220 in all of last year.I came into the home stretch only needing to see 3 more species. In the dead of winter my best bets were to focus on waterfowl and gulls. There were a few songbirds missing from my list, most notably Cedar Waxwings, but I decided to play the odds and focus on coastal habitats.During the week, Heydi and I found a lone Purple Finch in Prospect Park. That left me with only two to go. I decided to go out to Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge on Saturday to try and locate a Barrow's Goldeneye that had been recently reported. This is a rare bird in NYC, so it would be worth trudging around in near frostbite weather. While most of the refuge is in the borough of Queens, the Brooklyn border runs along the western edge of the West Pond and up through Pumpkin Patch Marsh. Any birds seen on the west side of the pond and beyond were fair game.I took the &quot;A&quot; train to the Broadchannel station, where I met my friend. The refuge is just a short walk from the train. Most of the West Pond was frozen, but a small section remained open at the Brooklyn edge. As we walked towards the pond, a large flock of Snow Geese took flight and headed out over the bay. A flock of black ducks were still in the narrow stretch of open water in the pond. Among the common waterfowl were 19 Northern Pintails. That brought me up to 99 species. We spent a long time scanning the bay and marsh in search of the Barrow's Goldeneye, but never found it. Next stop would be Dead Horse Bay.We took Q53 bus from in front of the refuge. That took us into Rockaway, where we transferred to the Q35, which stops in front of Floyd Bennett Field, and across from the Dead Horse Bay trailhead. The scaup flock at Dead Horse, unbelievably, seemed to have grown even larger than the 20,000 birds from my last visit. Most were in the water, but some of the flock was sleeping high up on the shoreline while others walked back to the water's edge. I'd never seen a scaup walking before and, with legs set fairly far back on their body, they seemed awkward. Frigid northwest winds were blowing directly into our faces as we scanned the huge flock. Numb faces and fingers finally forced us to pack up our scopes before we could do a really thorough search for any unusual birds in the flock.Once across Flatbush Avenue, we walked the pathway along the edge of Floyd Bennett Field, towards Aviator Sports. At one point, Heydi stopped to point out a flock of sparrows in the vegetation at the edge of the fence. It was a flock of American Tree Sparrows - or species number 100!After a hot chocolate break we continued birding Floyd Bennett. We spent time at the Cricket Field, the main grassland, Ecology Village and Archery Road, before heading back to Flatbush Avenue and the Q35 bus. I didn't add any other species to my month list, but Heydi was able to add an Eastern Meadowlark to hers.Here is a breakdown of my January species list with the location and date of the first sighting. The links for each location will bring you to a Google Earth map of that spot.Locations: Breezy Point; Brighton Beach; Coney Island Creek Park; Coney Island Pier; Dead Horse Bay; Dreier-Offerman Park; Floyd Bennett Field; Gravesend Bay; Green-Wood Cemetery; Hendrix Creek; Jamaica Bay West--Brooklyn; Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge; Plum Beach; Prospect Park; Sheepshead Bay; Spring Creek Park--North Channel Marsh1) Snow Goose - 01/16/10 (Floyd Bennett Field, Brooklyn)2) Brant - 01/06/10 (Gravesend Bay, Brooklyn)3) Canada Goose - 01/01/10 (Prospect Park, Brooklyn)4) Mute Swan - 01/01/10 (Prospect Park, Brooklyn)5) Wood Duck - 01/01/10 (Prospect Park, Brooklyn)6) Gadwall - 01/06/10 (Prospect Park, Brooklyn)7) American Wigeon - 01/16/10 (Plum Beach, Brooklyn)8) American Black Duck - 01/01/10 (Prospect Park, Brooklyn)9) Mallard - 01/01/10 (Prospect Park, Brooklyn)10) Northern Shoveler - 01/01/10 (Prospect Park, Brooklyn)11) Northern Pintail - 01/30/10 (Jamaica Bay West, Brooklyn)1...</body></row>

                    The Denver/Boulder Better Business Bureau is warning phone customers about an unethical and illegal practice that is surfacing in Colorado. It?s called slamming. 
 
The BBB says it has 59 complaints against Business Network Long Distance. 
 
According to the complaints, personnel from Business Network Long Distance are calling customers and falsely identifying themselves as their service provider. They allegedly say there has been a computer problem and they need to correct a billing issue. 
 
But customers say once the caller gets their information, their service is switched.  The customers say they are now facing extra charges and increased bills. 
 
Here are some tips from the BBB on how to avoid Slamming: 
 
          Do not trust calls received from someone stating they are your phone service provider. Contact your provider directly to confirm whether or not they contacted you and why. 
 
          Freeze your current phone service. This will prevent any switching unless you authorize it directly with verbal or written communication to your service provider. 
 
          Examine your bills very carefully each month and if you see something that doesn?t look familiar, contact your service provider immediately and inquire.

<body>This just in from Brooke Arthur, bar manager at Range — where the cocktail selections are some of our favorite in town:

While having coffee yesterday and looking over some old cocktail books, I was trying to figure out a replacement for one of our bourbon drinks as apples are going out of season. I was remembering that the pastry department had a bunch of pealed bergamot oranges that they had given us that I wanted to fit in. I remembered an old &quot;Range Classic&quot; the &quot;Third Rail&quot; that has frequented our menu often that one of my bartenders Jeff Lyon came up with. It is bourbon based with almost a half ounce of fee's oj bitters, lemon, honey syrup, and Lillet, kind of an upgraded whiskey sour. It has always been very popular, customers even order it when it is off the menu. The Third Rail has a very bitter orange peel element that I thought would be great to modify and make seasonal with the bergamot. So yesterday at work Jeff and I fooled around and replaced the bitters and lemon with the bergamot juice and sold it as our &quot;cocktail of the day.&quot; It sold like crazy, and now it's on the regular menu.

B Line

1.5 oz Bulliet Bourbon
.75 oz. Lillet Blanc
.5 honey syrup (1:1, honey and water)
1 oz. Bergamot juice
2 dash angostura orange

Add all ingredients into a cocktail shaker, add ice, shake 20 times, fine strain into a cocktail glass, garnish with an orange twist.

<body>Welcome to this weekend’s link-o-rama! This time, with images! First we have for you a ton of events, because what are you doing this weekend? Well, a whole lot NOW, right? DUH OF COURSE.
If you missed Mine when it played earlier this year, you can catch it tonight, Saturday Feb. at 7 at Hollywoof, with your dog(s)! What? OK, it’s this crazy fundraiser by Dogopolis, and actually there will be a double-feature with Sniff. If your dog is unhappy all cooped up because of the bad weather, this is how to make it up to him/her. It’s at Dogpile Dogs, 1338 Illinois St., and the doors open at 4:30 p.m.
Too much for you? Take your dog to the Grateful Dogs Rescue happy hour at Doc’s Clock (2575 Mission St. at 22nd Street) from 4 to 8 p.m. today. Proceeds will benefit Chico and Georgie of GDR.
The BAARN Activist Showcase is tonight, at the SF SPCA (243 Alabama St.) from 6 to 9. Admission is free; there will be snacks. Don’t show up too drunk after the GDR happy hour, OK? That is seriously unprofessional.
Hey South-Central Bay! The super-cool kids of the San Lorenzo Valley High School Animal Right Club are having a bakesale for Haiti on Thursday, Feb. 11 at noon on the Senior Lawn! I am being 0 percent sarcastic when I say super-cool kids, I wish we’d had an Animal Rights Club at my high schools. Good luck, SLVARC, you guys are The Best!
Everyone’s favorite CELEBRITY VEGAN CHEF Tal Ronnen will teach a course on plant-based cooking at the California Culinary Academy on Wednesday, Feb. 10 from 1 to 2:30 p.m. You can attend! RSVP by Monday (Feb. 8) to Kristin Treat. If you can’t make it, he’ll be at the Whole Foods (ugh) at 1765 California St. on Thursday, Feb. 11 from noon to 2 p.m., giving a demonstration  featuring Gardein.
Vegansaurus’ beloved Rocket Dog Rescue is holding a fundraiser on Thursday, Feb. 11 at Elixir (3200 16th St. at Guerrero Street) from 9 p.m. to last call to benefit a puppy with Parvo and a puppy with a cleft palate. Per usual, there will be a raffle with terrific prizes, plus vegan cupcakes, and local cewebrity bartenders! Be there or be a big selfish jerk!!!
Check out Soul Food For Thought/The Real Roots of Liberation on Friday, Feb. 12 at the Herbst Theater (401 Van Ness Ave. at McAllister Street). It’s sponsored by the SF Vegetarian Society, In Defense of Animals, and Go Vegan Radio, and is a celebration of Black History Month and a benefit for the International Fund for Africa. Get your tickets now; get more information from Bob Linden of Go Vegan Radio.
Don’t forget, the next SF Vegan Bakesale is happening on Saturday, Feb. 13 from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. at Ike’s (3506 16th St. at Sanchez Street)!! It’s going to be great and you know it!
And now, your weekend readingThe 2010 Big Eat SF by 7x7 magazines names eight items that are verifiably vegan, in a list of 100. I believe this is better than last year’s list, even though at least two of these items are cocktails.
The President wants to decrease farm subsidies! And increase funding to school lunch programs, using the money the government wouldn’t be subsidizing devil-companies like Monsanto and DuPont! I am dreaming, aren’t I?
The greatest nation in the history of nations, Iran, put a bunch of live animals in a rocket and shot it into space on Wednesday, because Scientific Progress. The animals include one rat, two turtles, and an undisclosed number of worms. There is no word on what will happen to the animals, but Iran is totally talking to GOD, so that’s all right.
The Manolo tells Kanye and his incoherent “defense” of wearing fur to shut it.
Boldtype makes a (non-comprehensive) list of fictional works with animal points of view.
One of Vegansaurus’ founding editors returned to her hippie college for hippies this week! We’re so proud of her! We also hope she gets lots of use out of PETA’s Vegan College Cookbook, which apparently makes copious use of the microwave. One of my worst cooking-related college memories involves tacos and a grease fire; one of my best involves a vegan pineapple upside-down cake. Tell us your college cooking stories, p...</body></row>

<body>Although San Francisco is regarded as one of the most exciting dining destinations in America, The Castro is not a neighborhood that often comes to mind. Just a few blocks from the epicure Mission district, in a quiet, dark corner of 17th street, is a newly opened neighborhood restaurant that promises to light up the local dining scene. And attract Bay Area foodies like moths to the broiling flames.The small dining room has a lineup of sixteen narrow tables arranged closely together like a Parisian coffee shop. Diners squeeze in with an economy-class-like proximity that may upset the eventual claustrophobe. But the charming atmosphere and stellar service more than make up for it. And when you’re eating well, suddenly nothing else matters. When was the last time you complained about personal space while dining in Paris?On the walls, black &amp; white prints depicting vegetables and fruits look like artful x-rays of edible flora. Perhaps a nod to the chef’s celebration of local ingredients.Behind Frances is the talented Melissa Perello; a multi-award-winning rising star chef that once headed the fine dining kitchens of Charles Nob Hill and Fifth Floor.The menuPerello serves New American fare with local ingredients and Franco-Italian inspiration. Portion sizes are just right, especially if you order four courses. Begin with bouchés, small size starters ideal for sharing; there are five to choose from ($6.50 each). Four appetizers ($8 to $11), four entrées ($17 to $23) and 3 sides ($6 each) may not seem like a lot of options for an à la carte menu, especially if you plan on a few returning visits. But everything I had was really good. So good in fact, I was happy to have it once more.The mealWhile bread is served upon request, Rosemary, sage almonds start every meal.From the bouchés, Applewood smoked bacon beignets, crème fraîche &amp; chives. Who says you can’t deep-fry bacon? These savory little fritters are crispy and tasty. Definitely a good start.Panisse frites, crispy chickpea fritters, Meyer lemon aioli. A thin, crispy crust is all that is between you and this creamy snack. Perfect for sharing — although you may not want to.Grilled calamari, Musque de Provence pumpkin, preserved lemon &amp; currants. A light salad with perfectly cooked calamari.From the appetizers, Roasted winter squash soup, maple scented crème fraîche. A smooth soup with nicely balanced flavors.Semolina gnocchi, duck confit and braised cavolo nero. Pan seared for a lovely golden crust, the dumplings are beautifully complemented by tender duck and black-leaf kale.Chicken liver mousse, frisée, currants and toasted bread. This is the kind of appetizer that has a curious blinding effect on me — the type that makes me ignore all the surrounding dishes.  “Order me, order me.”, I hear it whispering me from me menu. It took me 2 visits and a canceled reservation to finally try Perello’s CLM. It was worth it. Served in a quenelle, it has the delectable texture of a semifredo and a complex flavor with hints of red wine and a delicate sweetness. Like Range’s, an appetizer so good you can have it for dessert.From the entrées, Grilled bavette steak, cipollini onions, green garlic “chimichurri”. This fibrous cut of meat is marinated and sliced across the grain to achieve the tenderness of more noble beef. The result is a flavorful steak, here complemented by sweet onions and drizzled with a fresh take on the classic Argentinean sauce—originally made with parsley.Caramelized Atlantic scallops, creamy fingerling potatoes, wild mushrooms. Simply put, one of the best scallop dishes I ever had. The sweet mollusks are combined with the earthiness of the mushrooms, a hearty sauce and finished with delicate herbs.Sonoma duck breast, butter bean ragout, sautéed escarole, cotechino sausage. Tender duck served with beans cooked al dente and slices of lightly spicy pork sausage; an Italian good luck charm.Lacinato kale and crêpe cannelloni, maitake mushrooms, Andante “Cadence”. Made with a chefs-favorite pungent cow &amp; goat milk’s cheese from Andante Dairy, earthy Japanese mushrooms a...</body></row>

<body>Tonight's game was a tough physical battle, as expected from the Bruins. But the Cardinal started out strong and took and held a lead of nine points or so for the first ten minutes. Then the Bruins cranked up the pressure and were briefly ahead by a couple of points and were just four points behind at the half. 
The pressure continued in the second half, but the Cardinal were in control. More pressure was accompanied by more fouls, and the Cardinal kept making most of their free throws and  were able to set their own offensive pace. Final score: Stanford 74, UCLA 53.
At the postgame Q &amp; A session, a fan commented on how well the team handled UCLA's pressure and asked if they had practiced that a lot. Tara said, &quot;Yes, but Jayne didn't practice and Jeanette didn't practice and JJ didn't practice and Mel didn't practice  ? the ones who were best-prepared never got to play.&quot;
Jayne had a huge game, playing as if she's well aware that she has just three more regular season games at Maples. She scored a season-high 23 points. She had  13 rebounds for the only double-double  ? her eighth of the season. She now needs just four more rebounds to exceed the Stanford career record currently held by Nicole Powell. She also had three blocks. As to the flagrant (not intentional) foul for which she was ejected from the game, there's plenty  about that in the game reports.
Ros also had a great game. She played her usual dogged defense and scored 14 points on a three-pointer and several strong drives to the basket.
Nneka looked tired, but still had 15 points and seven rebounds. Kayla had the reverse ? seven points and 15 rebounds.
Jeanette played for 35 minutes and had eight assists with just three turnovers. Her assist-to-turnover ratio is now 2.07, second-best in the Pac-10 to JJ's 2.27. She also had 10 points, two rebounds and two steals.

Craft breweries now use cans lined with a water-based coating that prevents the beer from ever touching metal, so there's no metallic flavor.

<body>Today is an auspicious day in cycling, as all over North America Subaru-driving Belgian beer enthusiasts are wetting their waders over the announcement that Louisville, Kentucky will host the cyclocross masters world championships in 2012 and the elite world championships in 2013:This is easily the most shockingly lavish gift from Europe to the United States since Barack Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize.  In determining the location of the world championships the UCI had to consider a number of compelling bids, including one from Portland which involved routing the competitors through an elaborate reconstruction of the &quot;Three's Company&quot; set, beer hand-ups from specially-trained chimpanzees, and a custom machined bottle opener and $35 Stumptown Coffee gift card for the winner in each category.  Ultimately, though, the UCI decided that the sport of cyclocross should retain some dignity, and so cyclesport shall be spared the spectacle of the most ironic cyclocross race the world has ever seen for at least a few more years.  Still, cyclocross-mad Portlanders will no doubt descend on Louisville in 2013, where they will be easily identifiable by their constant complaints about inferior beer and coffee, insufficient mud, and the total lack of a category for their dogs.In the meantime, I'm pleased to present you with a quiz.

<body>One Brooklyn Bridge Park is back on top in the race for the priciest condo in the borough. A 9,486-square-foot triplex in the 438-unit Brooklyn Heights building was recently snatched up for $8.495 million by the founder of an investment management firm, who purchased the unit through a limited-liability corporation to veil his identity. The spacious loft actually comprises six units of the original development’s plan: the buyer combined three two-bedrooms, a one-bedroom and two studios to create the space. A previous buyer, who walked away from a $600,000-plus deposit after the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008, had already merged three of those units. One Brooklyn Bridge Park is roughly 30 percent sold. The most expensive Brooklyn condo in 2008 was a $7 million loft in David Walentas’ the Clock Tower Building, which is now back on the market for $8.5 million. But neither loft will have a fighting chance for the priciest prize if Walentas manages to sell the Clock Tower’s crown jewel this year, a triplex penthouse listed for $25 million. The unit, which features a four-sided glass-faced clock and birds-eye views of the Statue of Liberty and the Empire State Building, was recently eyed by the likes of Jay-Z and Ralph Lauren.

<body>Pratt Institute's graduate Preservation &amp; Planning Spring semester studio will be focused on the Columbia Waterfront neighborhood of Brooklyn. Their goal is to assess the land uses, economic conditions, and quality-of-life issues in the neighborhood and make recommendations as to how to address physical deficiencies, preserve historic and contemporary places of value to the community, and enhance economic development. The students will conduct place-based research and community outreach, prepare an analysis of the strengths/weaknesses/opportunities/threats in the neighborhood, and develop plan elements that address these conditions. The goal of the studio's work will be to prepare a final plan and present it the community.A key component of the studio is consultation with community members, beginning with an open meeting on Thursday, January 28 at 7:00 pm at LICH. The agenda will include a brief presentation of historical information compiled last semester, followed by a forum where participants will be asked to share their concerns about and aspirations for the neighborhood. Meeting Date: January 28, 2010Time: 7:00 pm to 8:30 pmLocation: LICH building onHicks Street, just off Atlantic Avenue. We’re reserved under Columbia Waterfront Neighborhood Assn. / Pratt Presentation. The security guard will direct you to conference room F/G -which is a short distance down the hall.Please RSVP to: melissaum@gmail.com</body></row>

<body>Ad-deral is a column in which we rant and riff on the ridiculous ads we're subjected to while trapped on the subway.? From the borderline racist local businesses (1-800-MARGARITA Divorce Attorneys) to the condescending national brands that pretend to know what it's like to ride the goddamned F train every day (Snickers, Delta), we'll tackle them all with the same smug outlook that has made us totally (not) famous. 
Okay, so I wasn't able to get a very good photo on the F train since it was a banner ad and I was concentrating on holding on for dear life as we were hurtling through the depths of Brooklyn at about 700mph [ed. note: 700MPH! On the F!? I can run faster than that fucker...], BUT, check this bullshit out: Introducing the B1 Patch!?
When I first saw it, I was all like, is it one of those gross birth control patches that Sarah Fittante would wear back in high school?? You know, the one that you could see creeping out from under her Victoria's Secret sweat pants?? The one that had a layer of crusty dirt forming around it?? They're called PILLS, people...pills and condoms.? Jesus Christ.
But NO, the B1 Patch has NOTHING to do with killing babies that may or may not pop up in your mufin top, it's supposed to help cure your hangover!
Hmm.
As someone who can drink a gallon of beer at Farrell's and still get up for work at 7AM the next morning, I don't really feel the need to slap a patch on my ass.? But for people like my mother, who drink two glasses of Chardonnay and then spend the next two days in bed whining about how they think they might die, this B1 Patch might be the answers to all your prayers.
Billed as the &quot;ultimate NATURAL defense,&quot; the B1 Patch supposedly reduces your hangover without &quot;killing your buzz.&quot; Genius, cause as we all know: no one likes a buzz kill, am I right?? Am I right??
Here's some propaganda from their site: &quot;B1, also known as Thiamine, is a vital nutrient in the digestion of carbohydrates, and the breakdown of alcohol in the body. It is also vital to the central nervous system. Because Thiamine is depleted so rapidly when breaking down alcohol, replenishing B1 in your system is critical to feeling your best. Simply apply this patch to a hairless portion of your skin [so dudes, not your ass]. The B1 patch will not stop you from feeling intoxicated, or buzzed. But it will dramatically reduce negative physical side effects from consuming alcohol.&quot;
So what do you think?? Can you head out to the Old Carriage Inn, drink 14 beers and still wake up feeling fresh as a daisy thanks to this mysterious new patch?
Doubtful.?
And judging by the army of skanks they're using in their ads (see above) and all over their site, this thing was probably dreamed up by some douchey rohypnol-carrying, Girls Gone Wild watching dude from New Jersey.?
I'm sticking with my regular regimen of water, ginger ale, and Totino's Pizza Rolls.?</body></row>

<body>Note: More media content is available for this story at BrooklynPaper.com.By Stephen BrownThe Brooklyn PaperThe Brooklyn Cyclones will no longer call their homefield “Keyspan Park,” ushering in a new era for the beloved minor league baseball team.

The team announced today that it has ended its naming rights agreement with National Grid, which merged with the utility company, Keyspan, in 2007. 

The team said it planned to announce a new naming rights sponsor soon.

“Keyspan and National Grid enjoyed a great partnership with the Cyclones,” said National Grid Vice President John Caroselli. “However, due to the fact that the Keyspan name no longer exists, it was an opportunity for both parties to discuss other options.”

The original naming rights deal on the stadium, which opened along the Coney Island Boardwalk in 2001, was supposed to run through 2020.

But once Keyspan was bought by the British energy giant three years ago, there was little doubt that the ballpark’s name would have to change someday. The Keyspan Park sign remains affixed to the stadium itself. It is unclear if the Cyclones or the Parks Department will try to sell it to Cyclones fanatics (a la the New York Yankees).

Spokesmen for the Cyclones and National Grid would not be disclose the value of the naming rights deal. Given the current economy, it seems likely that a new deal will carry as lower pricetag.

The search for a sponsor for the Cyclones’ diamond is not the only thing new this year. Last year, the team announced that former Mets second baseman Wally Backman will manage the Cyclones in their seemingly endless quest for postseason glory.Comment on this story.</body></row>

<body>?Bronx Science lost its January match-up with against DeWitt Clinton, but is hoping to ride a three-game winning streak into the postseason. (Photo by Adi Talwar)

The gymnasium at the Bronx High School of Science (or &quot;Bronx Science&quot;) is an interesting experience for one attuned to the sights of a traditional American sports hall. For one thing, a traditional American sports hall probably lacks the huge placard that greets those entering Bronx Science’s gymnasium, featuring the faces of seven stoic looking men arranged underneath the text “Alumni Winners of the Nobel Prize.”

Indeed, this school is a place of learned adolescents. Athletics, it would seem to the untrained eye, remains a difficult equation for the students at Bronx Science.

The stereotype is that students at Bronx Science are not jocks. They tell jokes about parabolas and physics equations. They're probably used to hearing the term &quot;nerd.&quot; 

But to believe that brains would inhibit the Bronx Science basketball team’s ability to play is a gross underestimation. These boys may spend their days with their heads buried in textbooks, but on the court they play ball like mad dogs.

Coach Sammel Brown remarked on the attention the team’s academic reputation attracts: jeers and trash talking from fans of other teams. 

“I’ve heard it all,” said Brown, “I provoke it...we hear the jeers, I tell [the team], ‘this is what their saying, so lets make them feel destroyed.’” Brown invites the negativity. “We feed off it,” he says.

A public school that requires an entrance exam from prospective students, Bronx Science is given an understandable disadvantage when it comes to athletics. Without a large pool of students flowing into the school, athletic talent is harder to come by. 

“It is a disadvantage,” Brown says, “but I think if you prepare the kids in the same way they pick it up faster.”

This season the team has picked it up especially fast. Their current record, 11-6, boasts more wins than the team’s last two seasons combined. 

Much of this improvement comes with Coach Sammel Brown, who spent three years coaching at the Eagle Academy For Young Men before coming to Bronx Science in 2009. Brown brought with him a philosophy that the team, no matter how disadvantaged, could play with anybody.

Now, with only a few games left in the team’s regular season, they look toward the post season, and the ultimate goal of performing in the Federation State Championships in Glens Falls. The season has been long, and the team has given up several pivotal victories, including a tough loss after their second meeting with local rival DeWitt Clinton in January. 

Coach Brown spoke about how that loss forced the team to focus on their priorities. “We sat there for an hour after the game talking about the season,” said Brown, “and there we decided we will be upstate at Glens Falls competing for the title.”

Whether or not they make it that far, however, depends on the team’s ability to continue matching wits with faster, stronger, or taller opponents.

Bronx Science has won their three last games, knocking down Evander Childs, Christopher Columbus, and Walton in that order. They face Grace Dodge tomorrow, Feb. 3, and the tough Alfred E. Smith Tech., currently 14-3, on Friday.</body></row>

<body>Just as Scharffen Berger was sold to Hershey, Tcho, a two-year-old chocolate company operating out of a warehouse on Pier 17, stepped in to take its place as San Francisco’s Willy Wonka. Not to say the companies are the same: Tcho has handily distinguished itself by incorporating technology and modern social ideas with an age-old craft. The company, led by co-founder and “chief chocolate officer” Timothy Childs—a former NASA shuttle technologist—and CCO Louis Rossetto (the founder of Wired), has revolutionized cacao sourcing and fermentation by implementing sophisticated technology on plantations; providing producer partners with high-skill job training; and monitoring the chocolate process from “bean to bar.” The company also gives growers the surprisingly uncommon opportunity to make and taste chocolate from their own beans. Tcho recently added a selection of professional-grade chocolate to its basic line of four chocolate bars with different taste profiles and has just started selling its chocolate at Starbucks. A multimedia factory tour is under development, and 2010 will also see the launch of three new chocolates—floral, earthy and a “serious” milk. “Yes,” admits Rossetto, “we are treating this like a tech start-up. It’s Silicon Valley meets SF food culture.We’re rigorous, smart, focused and yet have a passionate approach to reinventing and reimagining things that have been traditional.”</body></row>

      February 5, 2010. A cold, partly sunny day in New York. The weatherman has forecast all kinds of winter storms coming our way in the next 24 hours. We shall see, said the blind man.
        
          Yesterday afternoon at 3:30 at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home on Madison Avenue at 81st, they held a memorial service for David Brown, the film producer and husband of Helen Gurley Brown, who died this past Monday morning at about 3 a.m. David was 93 and had been ailing for the past year or so. The obituaries said that he died of kidney failure.
        
        David was the sort of man who seemed philosophical about the fates although he had a long life of good health and used his time enjoying himself working at his chosen interests and assisting his wife at hers. Yesterday both Richard Zanuck, his longtime production partner, and Frank Bennack, Vice Chairman and President of Hearst Corporation, in their eulogies to David cited the article in Esquire, some of which was re-published on the these pages this past Tuesday.
        
        
          
            
            
          
          
            David and Helen.
          
          
            
          
        
        Both Bennack and Zanuck ended with David’s conclusion of a success: “to live a long life and die in your sleep.” Done.
        
        Someone asked me afterwards if the memorial was a sad one. On the contrary, it was not. That was partly because of David’s pre-observation: he’d lived a long life and did indeed die in his sleep. However, it was also not a sad one because the remembrances (which included those of his longtime assistant and a longtime family friend of his and Helen’s) were full of funny anecdotes which characterized not only his life but also his personal enjoyment of life. Most of the laughs had something to do with sex.
        
        All the eyes in the room were on his new widow, his beloved Helen, who was enjoying the remembrances as much as the rest of us. What was unique about their marriage was that it seemed integrated entirely into their professional lives. Frank Bennack recalled David once saying that when he went to a premiere by himself, there were no paparazzi looking to photograph him but when he went with Helen, there was a bank of them wanting her picture. David loved that. They were complete partners. Her first best-selling book was his idea. Her transformation of Cosmo from the dying magazine of another era into the biggest selling title in the history of Hearst was also his idea. 
        
      Together and separately they were enormously successful in their businesses. Bennack also reported that at home, Helen always arose first in the morning and did her exercises. Then when David got up later, his exercise was weighing himself which he’d report to Helen: “same as yesterday.” Then she’d make him his breakfast of scrambled eggs and toast, prune juice and coffee. Then the two would start their day. He’d go to his office and she’d go to hers (Helen always took the bus to and from home – she was famously thrifty and also liked being close to her readership in life).
    
  
  
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
  
  
    
      
    
  
  
    
      Frank E. Campbell's funeral home right after the memorial service for David Brown. 
      Steven Spielberg, whose first two major films, Sugarland Express and Jaws were produced by Zanuck-Brown, attended the service.
    
  
  
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
  
  
    
      From his Esquire interview: “Work yourself to death. It’s the only way to live.” Indeed, he was living (and dying) proof. Those of us who knew him were blessed, but millions and millions of others who never knew him, and most of whom didn’t even know his name or who he was, were also blessed to have been graced by his presence for that quick long life.

<body>Marcia Smith said she has trouble determining if the commuter vans she takes each day to work as a patient care associate and to graduate courses at Long Island University are licensed or not.
The Cambria Heights resident is not alone as unlicensed vans cruise southeast Queens streets illegally picking up unwitting customers at bus stops, along busy roads and in other locations where it is against the law to do so.
Leaders are taking notice of the problem and the safety and economic concerns it raises. City Councilman Leroy Comrie (D-St. Albans), hosted a news conference Friday afternoon, attended by more than two dozen licensed van drivers and owners of van companies at a South Jamaica community van staging area to draw attention to the problem and implore the NYPD and city agencies to increase enforcement of van industry laws and regulations.
“I use the vans, but it’s hard for me to tell what’s a legal van and what is not,” Smith said Friday. “There are times when I’m just rushing and I just get on a van. I applaud the efforts to address this situation.”
Comrie said increasing numbers of illegal van drivers cause a host of problems for passengers and licensed van operators. The No. 1 concern, he said, is the safety of passengers since drivers who do not hold commercial drivers’ licenses, or CDLs, and do not work for legitimate companies have less of an incentive to provide safe, satisfactory rides for riders who use their services. Drivers present at the event told tales of unlicensed vans driving on sidewalks, running red lights and engaging in other unsafe activities.
“What is plaguing the van drivers are all the illegal vans that are stealing their business. These companies are paying up to $100,000 a year in fees to be able to even be on the road,” Comrie said, referring to legitimate operations. “We have too many people that wake up in the morning and get in a van to steal these drivers’ fares. If people are paying 100 grand a year, it’s upon the city to do all they can to protect the industry.”
The preponderance of unlicensed vans presents hardships for licensed drivers, who pay tens of thousands of dollars annually for permits, fees and insurance for the privilege to carry passengers, according to Gladstone Barrett, a driver for Yours ‘n Mine Transportation Service in Jamaica, who said he shells out $8,500 a year just to insure his van.
He said the law-abiding drivers’ profits are undercut by illegal van drivers who ignore regulations and laws, forge permit window stickers issued by the city’s Taxi and Limousine Commission, or TLC, and otherwise skirt proper procedures. Barrett advocates increased authority for the TLC to fine and penalize offending drivers.
“It’s time for the city to step up and better regulate the van industry to protect customers. When TLC comes out here and tows an illegal van, the drivers tear the ticket up and just go pay the tow fee and they’re back on the street in two hours,” Barrett said. “They do that because they’re not in TLC’s system, so what TLC needs to do is when they tow an illegal van, charge them at least a $1,000 fine.”
The Queens district attorney’s office moved to enforce the van laws last Thursday, charging a licensed insurance broker with insurance fraud, among other crimes. He allegedly failed to pay $150,000 in premiums by under-insuring almost two dozen commuter vans operating in Far Rockaway, acting as if they were vanpools. A vanpool is a group of people who commute together in a van and split the cost.

<body>Verizon Communications Inc. on Tuesday posted an unusual loss for the fourth quarter, as a charge for layoffs in its shrinking landline business caught up with the growing, and profitable, wireless business.The nation's second-biggest phone company lost $653 million, or 23 cents per share, in the quarter. In the same period a year earlier it had a profit of $1.24 billion, or 43 cents per share.Excluding one-time items, mainly consisting of a $3 billion charge for severance and other costs associated with layoffs, Verizon says it earned 54 cents per share. That was a penny below the average analyst estimate, as polled by Thomson Reuters.Those estimates were already reduced, after Verizon warned early this month that it paid higher-than-expected subsidies to put phones in the hands of customers. Verizon Wireless is fighting to attract high-paying subscribers away from AT&amp;T Inc. and its exclusive iPhone. AT&amp;T reports earnings Thursday.Verizon's revenue rose 10% to $27.1 billion, largely due to the acquisition last January of Alltel Corp. Analysts were expecting $27.3 billion.New York-based Verizon ended the quarter with 222,927 employees, 7,413 fewer than it had in September. The layoffs have come on the traditional phone-company side, as many customers give up their lines in favor of using only cell phones or phone service from cable companies.Verizon Wireless, already the largest cell phone carrier in the country, added 2.2 million customers to end the year with 91.2 million. However, 1 million of the new customers signed up through a reseller such as Tracfone rather than directly through Verizon. Such customers generally pay much less than customers who sign contracts under the Verizon brand.Higher subsidies for phones meant that Verizon Wireless' operating margin shrank 2.6 percentage points to 27.3%. The competition in the wireless market has only gotten tougher since the quarter ended: Two weeks ago, Verizon cut the price of unlimited voice service to $70 per month from $100. AT&amp;T quickly made a similar move. Both carriers are betting on making back the money through higher charges for data service.It's not clear when AT&amp;T's exclusive hold on the iPhone ends, and Verizon might get an Apple device to sell this year. In the meantime, it's pushing phones running Google Inc.'s Android software as its main alternative to Apple's phone.Verizon Communications owns 55% of Verizon Wireless. It counts all the wireless revenue on its books, but 45% of the profits flow to joint venture partner Vodafone Group of Britain.</body></row>

<body>&quot;There were definitely two winners, and two that would require a lot more beer-drinking.&quot;



Clockwise from top left: Pizza Hut, Papa John's, Domino's, Little Caesars. [Photographs: Robyn Lee]

Since pizza is right up there with wings and guacamole as far as Super Bowl cuisine goes, we ordered pepperoni pizzas from the four big nationwide chains (Little Caesars, Pizza Hut, Papa John's and Domino's) to find the tastiest. Why pepperoni? Because most people order pizza with at least one topping and pepperoni is the most popular one in the U.S.Pizza Hut



Pepperoni: Whoa, they did not hold back. There's sure enough of pepperoni but, gack, it's pretty bland. Though it does get points for having nice, crisp edges.
Sauce: Opposite from the pepperoni situation. There's very little sauce and what's there is too herby.
Cheese: &quot;Wished this was lighter on the cheese,&quot; said one taster. (That's probably not a compliment to the cheese.)
Crust: Doughy and heavy without much flavor. Maybe a hint of garlic (maybe). 

Papa John's



Pepperoni: Good?spicy, meaty, crisp around the edges, and it kind of dissolves in your mouth. Plenty of it too.
Sauce: Sweet, but for some reason people seem to get behind the Papa John's sweetness. Thankfully it doesn't taste like ketchup or fake herbs, and it actually has a hint of a buttery undertone. 
Cheese: A little tangy; tastes like real cheese. 
Crust: A bit more done than the others (decent browning and crunch on bottom) and nice hole structure (those network of air bubbles). Not too thick, which is good?the others can be a chewing party. &quot;Weird, weird crust...not a horrible crust but it sure had a weird aftertaste,&quot; a few testers agreed.

Little Caesars



Pepperoni: Underseasoned (not quite spicy or salty enough) and undercooked (not browned at all).
Sauce: Not as candy-sweet as the others, but the problem was all the herbs. Or shall we say &quot;herbs.&quot; It had that shaked-on dry spice taste.
Cheese: More like greasy rubber. No real flavor, except maybe chemical.
Crust: Doughy and crunchless, this barely passes as cooked. Actually, one taster felt like it was cooked in a toaster, comparing it to Ellio's frozen pizzas. &quot;If you like toaster pizza, this is for you,&quot; said one taster.

Domino's



Pepperoni: More of a dark red (like real meat) than the disappointing, fake-looking orange. Nice meaty texture with a good amount layered per slice. 
Sauce: Still has that delivery pizza sweetness, but with a slight kick.
Cheese: The best cheese of the four: tangy, well-seasoned, and actually tastes like mozzarella. 
Crust: Breadier than the Papa John's crust but still had the same nice browning underneath. Intensely garlicky. There were food scientists hard at work here, but whatever you guys did, nice job. We'd eat another slice of this. 

Final Thoughts

There were definitely two winners, and two that would require a lot more beer-drinking. We'd recommend ordering Papa John's and Domino's. While Papa John's would be easy to graze on all game long, Domino's was the most aggressively flavored, so you might actually be good after a couple slices. Pizza Hut and Little Caesars, on the other hand, oh boy. 

Special Thanks

A big hug and spoonful of Pepto-Bismol goes out to The Food Lab's J. Kenji Lopez-Alt, Brownie of Blondie &amp; Brownie, and Doug Quint of the Big Gay Ice Cream Truck for putting their stomachs on the line to help the Serious Eats team get through a pile of pizza boxes. Naturally, there was pie (as in pie-pie, as in &quot;Elvis&quot; pie baked by Brownie involving bananas, peanut butter, and bacon?basically the pie version of this) for dessert.</body></row>

<body>The Prelude To The AIG BailoutThe financial crisis was mostly the result of a lot of bad credit decisions.  At the bottom were mortgage loans made to people whose ability to pay was dubious.  The worked for a while because the housing bubble made it possible for lenders to get paid if the loans weren't paid as agreed by foreclosing, even if the borrower couldn't pay.Then, these loans were bundled and repackaged into investments of varying levels of risk bought by people who overestimated their value.  But, these bad decisions were made, in part, because huge, reputable financial companies, like major investment bankers and AIG were willing to promise that the losses wouldn't be to big with a form of guarantee called a credit default swap.  Often lower tier financial companies made the initial guarantees and then limited their own liability by reinsuring their risk with larger companies.When iffy borrowers started to stop paying their loans, and housing prices started to fall leaving insufficient collateral to cover the entire loans, bad debt losses from these loans started to mount and the investments based on these loans quickly became &quot;toxic assets.&quot;AIG was at the top of the pyramid.  A tiny division of the company guaranteed or reguaranted mortgage based investments far beyond what it had any reasonable ability to make good on if the underlying loans went bad.  And those loans did go bad.What Did We Do And Why?Testimony before Congress about AIG, leaked to an accounting profession blog, will establish that regulators knew that AIG was about to collapse and go bankrupt because its obligation to make good on these guarantees far exceeded its ability to pay them.  So far, so good.  Some bad economic, regulatory and tax policies surely contributed to this situation, and almost everyone agrees that at least some reforms in these policies are necessary to prevent that from happening again.  But, by the time that Federal government officials and Wall Street was on the verge of really understanding what a mess it was in as a result, what was done was done.  The subprime industry was imploding, losses from mortgage backed investments were mounting, and the guarantees that had been made of these investments were in place and about to be called due.To prevent AIG from collapsing and defaulting on its guarantees to lots of huge financial companies and banks, the Federal government stepped in, took over AIG, and made good on a lot of the promises that AIG had made which AIG wouldn't have been able to make good on by itself.One of the most powerful questions Congress is considering, which our nation is considering in hindsight, having had the key information concealed from it at the time this was happening, is whether the Federal government did the right thing in dealing with this crisis.Information leaked already strong suggests that our sitting Treasury Secretary, then heading the Federal Reserve Bank in New York, successfully urge AIG to engage in securities fraud to hid that fact that it was on the verge of collapse.Thomas C. Baxter, general counsel of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York plans to tell Congress that:a bankruptcy by the insurer “would have had catastrophic consequences for our financial system and our economy.” He called the decision to rescue A.I.G. “a difficult one,” but one that the Fed’s policymakers felt compelled to make.Mr. Baxter explained that the New York Fed felt compelled to pay out A.I.G.’s counterparties in full to unwind derivative contracts because “there was little time, and substantial execution risk and attendant harm of not getting the deal done by the deadline of Nov. 10,” when A.I.G. was scheduled to report its earning and could face downgrades from credit ratings agencies. That would have led to more collateral calls and even greater liquidity problems for A.I.G., Mr. Baxter said.He added, “Even in a best-case scenario, we did not expect that the counterparties would offer anything more than a modest discount to par.” Under the circumstance, he said, “the Federal Reserve had little or n...</body></row>

<body>Right-wing extremists in Colorado would love to see public education fully defunded so they could force families to send their money to private corporations instead. ?Are they truly concerned about the state of education? ?Of course not. Like every other policy issue, they're much more interested in transferring the middle class' wealth (what remains of it) toward amoral, unaccountable entities that have more rights than people.&amp;#xD;Heading up this year's public-vs-private entity battle will be Proposition 101, one of three potential ballot initiatives that will show up this November 2nd. ?In a nutshell, Prop 101 would cut income taxes 0.1 percent a year until the rate was 3.5 percent - down from the current 4.63 percent - and reduce ownership taxes on used vehicles to $1 and to $2 for new vehicles. ?It would also repeal FASTER, enacted last year to begin work on billions of dollars worth of failing roads and bridges. How does that relate to education? Every school district in the state gets a share of those taxes.&amp;#xD;The Bell Policy Center is analyzing the effects of Prop 101 on a county-by-county basis. ?More on that below.  The Bell Policy Center's analysis has just begun, with only 6 counties' done so far. What they've seen in those 6 counties makes it clear that the right wing's goal of destroying public education would be achieved all too easily.&amp;#xD;Funding per student in Denver, for example, would fall off a cliff: from $434 to $6.08! ?Yes, I have placed the decimal point correctly. ?How could Denver's schools function if funding was slashed to 1/100th of today's funding? ?The answer is quite simple: they couldn't.&amp;#xD;How about Mesa County? ?Their funding per student would fall from $490 per student to $6.87.&amp;#xD;Alamosa County would see ownership taxes fall from $1.18 million per year to $18,891 per year. ?Their license fees would drop from $1.17 million (2009; $800,000 2008) to $183,910. ?Their school funding would be slashed by $250 per student.&amp;#xD;Early discussion about Prop 101 (Amendments 60 and 61 too) has revolved around lack of transparency regarding fundraising for the initiatives. ?If over $200 is spent on an initiative, state law requires registration with the Secretary of State's office. Protect Colorado's Communities has filed a complaint against the initiatives for failing to do so, despite spending money on 1,600 pages on which to collect petition signatures.&amp;#xD;You can bet that the hateful Douglas Bruce is somehow connected to these initiatives. ?His fingerprints have been all over every attempt to drown Colorado's government in a bathtub for years. ?According to the Colorado Springs Gazette:&amp;#xD;Opponents allege Colorado Springs' anti-tax advocate Douglas Bruce is one of the backers of the initiatives, ?but he has said he knows nothing about them. ?Freda Poundstone, who authored a famous amendment in the 1970s that kept the city and county of Denver from annexing land in nearby counties without a vote, is listed on papers connected with Proposition 101.&amp;#xD;Bruce's reputation has finally taken some hits in recent years as his involvement in Colorado's budget crisis has come to public light. ?I'm not surprised the Prop 101 and A60/A61 backers don't want to disclose who's funding their early efforts. They're all unpatriotic cowards.&amp;#xD;Colorado is at a crossroads this year. ?We can continue to undo the damage that Bruce and his acolytes have caused to the state by overwhelmingly voting against Prop 101, A60 and A61. ?Or, we can decide to finish the job he started.&amp;#xD;Cross-posted at DailyKos and WeatherDem - the blog.</body></row>

<body>The Greening of Denver. Denver residents understand that the local natural landscape isn't so natural. Every twig, every blade of grass that we see today is the result of a deliberate act of horticulture. In the past, Colorado's landscape designers took their cues from European gardens and European ideas rooted in the Romantic era, and later, the City Beautiful Movement. Over time, they came to their senses and developed a Colorado style based on a palette of native plants.

<body>Dear Members and Friends of DFC,  There he was standing about 15 feet from us, all 6 foot 10 inches of him. Denver knows him as the ?Birdman,? Chris Anderson.  Shaden and I had been given wonderful tickets by a generous DFC family. We enjoyed the game as the Nuggets beat the opponent handily. My son, Shaden, began pursuing any NBA basketball player he could trying to see if he could get a autograph or better yet, a headband or wristband. Shaden was standing on a chair jumping up and down yelling at the Birdman to please give him his headband.  To my amazement adults around us were also trying to help Shaden by encouraging the Birdman to give the little boy the headband.  Shaden was a true seeker. He was trying to have contact with a famous athlete. There was a wall that separated the general public from these famous athletes. You could seek all you wanted but not actually get close! We, the last few months, have seen true seekers at our altars. People who seek to have contact with our Lord Jesus Christ! Just last Sunday I prayed with a man who was recommitting his life to Christ. I also prayed with a couple who were seeking God?s best for their marriage. There is no greater sight than to see people seeking the Savior! What a beautiful and powerful scene to see people seeking and receiving help from the King of Kings!  Shaden couldn?t quite get the Birdman?s attention. He didn?t get the headband, Birdman walked away without noticing my son. There was that barrier and the Birdman couldn?t hear Shaden even though he was yelling. That is not the case with our God.  Jeremiah 29:13, ?You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart.?? God is being found among us! Of all the positive things I have seen and experienced here at DFC in the last three months, the most powerful and positive is seeing people seek God and experience God?s forgiving power and cleansing. There is no barrier because of the sacrifice of Jesus. Let?s all keep seeking Him!   Pastor Shawn</body></row>

<body>In New York, quirkiness comes with a price. Everyone is out there spending money on mastering their styles and trying to be different. Yet in the end, they all come out the same.?Nightclubs and bars are treated in a similar manner. They work hard in preparing weekly parties that will make their mark in the nightlife industry. While some of them are truly unique and entertaining, others are no different than the rest. While many of the city’s delightful and wonderfully strange bashes aren’t always advertised to attract a pretentious crowd, some parties are just too good to pass on. Whether you’re looking for an intense game of ping pong or just want to go back in time for some throwback fun, jumpstarting your nightlife before the weekend is fortunately possible and worth exploring. Here is our list of what might be seen as quirky from the eyes of a New Yorker. 
?
Top Quirky Weekly Party: Champagne Tuesdays @ Superdive200 Avenue A, New York, NY 10009 Who say champagne was just for New Year’s Eve? Head to this Manhattan favorite for Franch’s fine celebration wine on the cheap. Superdive is a fraternity-like dive bar in the East Village that caters to anyone looking for a good time. It is New York City’s first dive bar that offers keg service, daring you to show off that toga. However, on Tuesdays, they do things a little differently. Picture this: unlimited champagne served to you in a bathtub on wheels by a midget dressed like a pirate. If this picture is something that you want to see more of, then come to Superdive on Tuesday nights. All you need is a 20 dollar bill and your thirst for champagne will be quenched.
?
?
Top Quirky Weekly Party: Wednesday Night Swing @ Columbus 72246A Columbus Ave, New York, NY 10023Unlike most dance parties in New York, Columbus 72 is one venue that isn’t afraid to spin throwback hits.? Every Wednesday night it’s all about swing music performed by Joe Battaglia and his 17 piece band at this beautiful Upper West Side dance hall where you can wear your vintage threads and look like a real cool cat. While this party is for the 30+ demographic, it’s one of the few, highly successful swing nights in the city, making it a favorite among longtime patrons and curious firsttimers. Not only will you enjoy live music all night long and meet hundreds of new people, but the $15 admission also includes one free drink. With two rooms for dancing, there’s plenty of space to do the Lindy Hop or Jitterbug.
?
?
Top Quirky Weekly Party: Panic Paddle Mondays @ Rock Star Bar351 Kent Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11211Lounges that features ping pong games are quickly becoming a major trend in New York City nightlife, but a bar that offers free table tennis every Monday night? Now that’s what we call a steal, especially if you’re tired of the usual electronic clubanthems found in many nightclubs. Brooklyn’s Rock Star Bar hosts “Panic Paddle” every Monday night, a new ping pong/bar game that you won’t even find in Manhattan. Beginners are welcome to participate in this fast pace tournament and youcould even win free when games have at least 12 players. Enjoy a sound of rock and '80s hits at this cash bar favorite while breaking a sweat in the name of cocktails.
?
?
Top Quirky Weekly Party: Ladies Night All Male Review @ Play77-17 Queens Blvd, Elmhurst, NY 11373Girls, if you’re tired of trying to get your rocks off at a decent bash in the city, then you’re in for a major treat. Queens may not be known as a place for premier nightlife in the city, but trust us, you’ll be changing your mind very quickly. Every firstThursday of the month, PLAY hosts a sexy all male review where you can see the hottest guys and go-go dancers show how buff they really are. And let’s face it, can anyone resist some beefcake especially when it’s just for ladies? There’s also an open bar sponsored by Grey Goose Vodka to satisfy your thirst for vodka martinis. Play is sexy and sleek, but we believe it’s the sultry performers that get the crowd all hot and bothered.

      January 11, 2010. Cold and sunny winter weekend in New York. I stayed in except to go over to Zabars on Saturday, and to Fairway, and get a haircut at Jean-Louis David on 75th and Broadway. 
        
I’ve been getting my haircut there since I moved back here from Los Angeles in 1992. The haircut then was 12 bucks. Today it is $27. Sounds almost like inflation, no? 

Ludmilla has been my haircutter for the past twelve years. She is from the Ukraine. She is here with her parents and her two teenage children. She cuts mostly men’s hair, and is an excellent haircutter. And she’s fast, which I like; and  serious.

I thought I was the only customer aware of this. But then last year she went away for two weeks vacation. I learned this by walking in (without an appointment, as always) and discovering she’d been gone. The following Saturday I went in again, hoping she’d returned. Nope. The third Saturday I went in at one in the afternoon and learned that there was a three hour wait because of all the men who’d put off getting their haircut while Ludmilla was away. This went on for a couple of weeks. Good’s good.

Saturday. I spent the rest of the day and yesterday morning finishing a biography of Somerset Maugham (“The Secrets Lives of Somerset Maugham”) written by Selina Hastings and published in Britain by John Murray. I got my copy from someone who brought it over. I’ve been told it’s coming out in this country in the Spring.

I picked it up because a friend of mine had told me he spent the weekend reading it and that it was fascinating and juicy. Another friend of mine used that word too. I don’t know about juicy, but it is a very intimate biography.

There isn’t much you don’t learn (that’s learnable) about the man.  Furthermore Hastings writes about both sexes with ease and as much detail as to complete the picture.

I have not read much Maugham before. I’d seen some of the movies adapted from his plays, short stories, and novels. He has had more films (including TV) made of his works than any other author – 92! He is also a fascinating story, and it is told at the hands of a very thorough (and interested) writer. 

It was a long life, a very full life, a complicated life, a very professional life, a glamorous and famous and wealthy life; as well as a troubled, often sad, sometimes maddening life, recounted in the context of two centuries – he was born in 1874 and died in 1965. 


  
    
    
  
  
    The very fashionable Mr. and Mrs. Somerset Maugham (Willie and Syrie).
    
  
    
    

He served in both World Wars, traveled constantly, kept copious notes of everything and everyone he met, used them for his stories, and went out for more. He married once, had a daughter and grandchildren, had two male living companions who were in effect “wives” (the old time version – domestic labor, combined with companionship with the predictable subsequent resentments), whom he provided for generously, and worked. And worked. 

His mother, whom he adored (and who adored him -- he was the fourth and last son and much younger than his siblings), died when he was eight.  His father died a few years later. The loss of the mother punctuated his life with agony at the beginning and at the end.

Throughout reading Hastings’ compelling work (it took me a couple of weeks because of my time limitations and its length – 536 pgs), I would ask myself if I “liked” this man whom I was getting to know so well, so intimately. I certainly admired him and was in awe of his abilities. 

I have been writing all my life but never with the aplomb of technique that this man developed so brilliantly. He was a successful writer – by which I mean he was “compleat,” and he didn’t kid himself about his shortcomings either. He was very smart. And oddly kind, and generous, and other things you could live without. I loved the book.

<body>Though it looks like it's nothing new to the internet (there are some press mentions dating back to the early aughts) we thought we'd call some attention to Urinal.net, a handy guide for guys to urinals across the nation. The San Francisco selection seems especially rich, including the infamous R Bar urinal (pictured) which features pictures of women hanging above it, all pointing down toward your junk and laughing. 

Then there's the revelation that DNA Lounge very smartly installed indestructible, prison-grade urinals and toilets, in order to weather years of abuse by bridge-and-tunnel partyers. As one of the owners writes, &quot;some of the line items on the feature list were 'no crevices for hiding of contraband,' and 'suicide proof!'&quot;

I’ve been to a fair number of art openings, and many consist of a DJ mixing music as people sip drinks and converse about why they like a particular piece of work. Now, don’t get me wrong: art events are a cheap and easy way to meet people, support local talent, and occasionally score some free booze. But sometimes you need more of an incentive to go out. 

Enter S.I.R. (Surreality in Reality), a Japanese art crew residing in the San Francisco Bay area that aims to bridge cultures through different mediums and live art performances.  “Four Elements Vol. 3土 –Earth-” is their latest exhibition, the third installment of an elements of nature series (past exhibits incorporated water and fire).


The Pineapple, The Pineapple Stool and the Soil Girls, by Koji Nagao

The smell of smoke and sounds of laughter floated around Space Gallery's front entrance on opening night. Once I entered the small building, it was replaced by '90s hip-hop and the aroma of Red Stripe beer. The walls showcased photos printed on seed paper, oil and watercolor paintings, silk-screened graphic art, and sculptures.</body></row>

<body>Some of you may be familiar with the venerable Rosamunde Sausage Grill on Lower Haight street. It’s only about 20 square feet, but between it and its next door neighbor, the Toronado, I have spent many a perfect Saturday afternoon eating vegan sausage and drinking beer (don’t judge!). Now, Rosamunde has opened a brand spanking new Mission location (24th and Mission), complete with their very own beer list AND seating for, well, more than the 4 people the Haight location can accommodate.

First things first: Rosamunde is not a primarily vegan location. They serve meat sausages of ALL KINDS, and many people may choose to pass based on that, which is cool, because it just leaves more vegan sausages for me!
Rosamunde has a very simple concept: grilled sausages of various kinds on fresh french rolls with a choice of select toppings for around $6 and a close proximity to beer. The rolls are always super fresh and delicious, and the toppings pretty much rule: grilled onion, sweet peppers, hot peppers (or a mixture of both), saurkraut, and a range of mustards and ketchup. The Haight Street Rosamunde offers one vegan sausage: it’s a Tofurky variety (though I can never tell which kind - I think maybe the beer brat…), and it’s good, but there’s only the one kind. The new Mission spot offers a selection (!!!) of vegan sausages, which is fancy and makes having only a single option look like communist Russia. When we ate their last night, the ol’ ball and chain had an apple sage dealy, and I had the kielbasa. The menu lists the vegan sausage as a “daily offering,” so I am going to optimistically interpret that to read that they will offer a range of vegan sausages and be receptive to trying out new ones. YOU HEAR THAT, ROSAMUNDE?

In addition to just sausages, the Mission location also offers vegan baked beans, fries, the biggest, most obscene-looking pickles that you’ve ever seen, and vegan split pea soup. They also have a sausage platter that includes a sausage (or two), baked beans, and salad. Oh, and beer. They focus on quality, craft beers, and lots of their stuff on tap is of the strong persuasion. Handily, they list the alcohol content right next to the names and prices. OH! And (I almost forgot these) they also have Helwa vegan wafers in 3 or 4 different varieties. It’s a nice touch, especially if you get the kind of PMS I get where you need to have sugar, salty, and booze in your mouth all at once. Handy!
The atmosphere of the place is something like “German Hunting Lodge with DJ playing an odd mix of Dead Kennedys and Hot Water Music with basement-tattooed hipster counter person.” Sounds odd, yes, but it works. There are lots of long tables with benches for cramming many people in, and boy were there lots of people crammed in when we hit it up last night. Hopefully it’ll calm down a bit once it’s not so new, but for now at least, be prepared to wait 15 minutes or so for your sausage, which is okay, since they have all that beer.
The only complaint I have about this place (besides all the meat, which, let me clarify, sucks, but I’d rather have meaty places acknowledge, accommodate, and respect vegans than not) is that while they are open for breakfast (and even offer free coffee with breakfast! AMAZING), they don’t have a vegan breakfast sausage. Their current breakfast offering is a breakfast sausage with egg and cheddar. I know I’d be pretty happy to have a breakfast sausage with Cheesly and tomato and onion or something. JUST SAYING, ROSAMUNDE!</body></row>

<body>Stu Rothenberg warns Republicans against overconfidence: “Maybe House Republicans learned their lesson last week after President Barack Obama joined them at their retreat and proved once again to be a very formidable opponent rather than a mere foil.” 
ARIZONA: Channeling First Read, The Hill notes John McCain’s drift to more conservative position, as he protects his right flank before a summer primary. “McCain has reason to be concerned. According to a recent Rocky Mountain Poll, his favorable rating in Arizona has dropped to 40 percent overall, the lowest level since January 1994, when he was recovering from the Keating Five scandal, according to the Phoenix-based Behavior Research Center, which conducted the survey. Among Republicans, 52 percent approve of his job performance while 14 percent give him poor marks. This normally wouldn’t be a tough race for McCain, said Rep. John Shadegg (R-Ariz.): ‘The issue is there is this latent anti-incumbent, anti-establishment sentiment that J.D. can tap into.’” 
CALIFORNIA: Republican Senate candidate Carly Fiorina’s camp is up with a Web video whacking opponent Tom Campbell, calling him a Fiscal Conservative in Name Only or “FCINO,” and features some interesting imagery, including baa-ing sheep, a man dressed up in a sheep outfit with red eyes, and on. 
COLORADO: President “Obama is slated to do three fundraising events for [Democratic incumbent Sen. Michael] Bennet and the Colorado Democratic Party Feb. 18 in Denver.” 
FLORIDA: “Republican U.S. Senate candidate Marco Rubio has come out against including illegal immigrants in the national census -- even though doing so could significantly reduce Florida's political power and share of federal funding,” the Florida Herald-Tribune reports. “Rubio's stance sets him at odds not only with Gov. Charlie Crist, but also with Republicans in the Florida Legislature who are cranking up efforts to track down and find every resident who lives in the state. Rubio's opposition is largely theoretical -- the census has already started and illegals are being counted -- but it reflects his efforts to appeal to hard-line conservatives in the contest against the more moderate Crist.”

<body>The James Beard Award pre-nominations (or, &quot;semifinalists&quot;) were announced today. In the &quot;Outstanding Chef&quot; category, Charles Phan (The Slanted Door), Michael Minna (Michael Minna), and Gary &quot;Gummy Worm&quot; Danko (Gary Danko) all received hat tips. Flour + Water and Adesso received &quot;Best New Restaurant&quot; nods, and rightfully so. And Christopher Kostow received a &quot;Best Chef: Pacific&quot; nomination, so he's having a red-letter day of the deepest kind right now.

The final list of nominations will be ready come March 22. The prizes awarded on May 3. But for now, here are they are, all of them in one heap. Bay Area nods are bolded for your convenience. (Congratulations to you all! May your subsequent Food Network appearances be successful, camera-ready ones.)

<body>The only problem with Tommaso's is that to get a seat without waiting in line for quite a long time, you need to arrive before they open.  They open at 5:00pm Tuesday through Saturday, 4:00pm on Sunday.  There is usually a short line at the door even before they open. 

Probably too obvious to need mentioning, but they do not take reservations.

Their pizzas are famous for a reason.  Their coco clams are just delicious.  And I really like their cold vegetables in vinaigrette.  It's a great place for a group that wants to have good food and fun.</body></row>

<body>Hang around on lower Polk and you're bound to see some sights that'll make you want to flee, e.g., the lineup of &quot;ladies&quot; smoking outside &quot;Divas&quot;, the Loin's roving midget hooker, or far worse, a skateboard shop that sells...rollerblades. Sticking it out, totally unfazed, Lush Lounge.

Moving from their spot across from Divas into the much bigger digs that were once SF's creepiest skateshop, Lush's back on the scene with a new, equally eccentric bohemian-chic steez -- to find them, just look for the big glowing sign, which they share with their neighbor GNC (try the Creatini!). The wide-open space is awash in red/blue/green light and features a long, dramatically back-lit bar fashioned from old timber; slow-spinning, plantation-style ceiling fans n' fake parrots perched all around; and religious overtones born out by stone Buddhas, church pews, and a wall-mounted Our Lady of Guadalupe, to help you feel less awkward as the only virgin. Alcoholically, they've upped the ante with more bottles in each spirit category, and while the new cocktail menu's still under wraps, you can still enjoy girlish tastes of the old Lush (chocolate Martinis, frozen watermelon/mango drinks, etc.); the brew's also much improved, with 22 options that include Fat Tire, Blue Moon, and Negra Modelo on tap, which is rarely seen in SF unlike Frank Chu, who is watching you right now.  

They're waiting on permits to open up the mezzanine, which holds around 30 peeps and'll be rentable for private parties, i.e., the kind you can attend in your blades, free from the ridicule of trannies, tiny prosties, or far worse...skateboarders.</body></row>

<body>Again rolls around Daniel's birthday, and this time he chose Zachary's Chicago Pizza in Berekely as the venue to gather his friends.  I've heard nothing but good things about Zachary's since moving here in 1997, and somehow I'd never made it there until now.  Partly it could be that I've never been a fan of Chicago style thick pizza... seems sooo heavy.  It's a good thing to go somewhere despite your preconceived notions, since the pizza was fabulous!The interior walls are well covered with awards and amusing posters about eating at Zachary's.Daniel ordered four large pizzas, Mediterranean, Super Veggie,Spinach Mushroom, and Roasted Red Pepper.  All were delicious according to my tastebuds, and reports of the other 9 people around the table.Here's a close up of my slice of Super Veggie.  It was so stuffed with vegetables that it lightened it up.Miraculously, I found a no sugar added pecan pie after search four bakeries for something non-sugar per Daniel's request.  The ingredient list ready rather spookily, but it actually tasted quite fine.  We had a little fun with Daniel's candles. Happy Birthday Daniel!</body></row>

<body>Third generation chocolatier and French native Christophe Paume and his business partner/wife Carly have brought a beautiful gift to Charleston. Opening their first store, Christophe Artisan Chocolatier-Patissier, nearly a year ago in Mount Pleasant, the young couple opened a second shop by the same name on King Street two months ago.In so doing, they've brought a gorgeous bit of France home to roost in Charleston. The French take food and chocolate seriously. It is an art form for them, a way of nurturing body and soul. Paume makes chocolates more beautiful than I've ever seen in France - including the exquisite work of Pierre Herme - or anywhere in the world. His tempered delights receive hand-painted splashes of color from bright orange to deep lavender. They look like polished gems lined up in the tiny, ever-so-French shop on King Street, that charming Carly oversees. She'll hand-pick chocolates for you and delicately arrange them just so in their gorgeous red or chocolate-brown boxes. But what to pick? An Earl Grey infused dark chocolate ganache painted robin's egg blue with tiny dots, lemon puree in a milk chocolate ganache painted sage green with pale brown speckles, or the lavender caramel with a dark chocolate shell wrapped around homemade caramel infused with lavender? Those are just three of over twenty choices, then there are the truffles and the chocolate sculptures. Of these, my particular favorite is the delicate, deep mauve pump trimmed with burgundy, the female shoe and chocolate lover's dream come true all in one tempting, beautifully wrapped, edible package.Even non-chocolate crazies (and until visiting here, I counted myself as one of them) have to appreciate the labor of love and pure, unadulterated talent that is poured into each one of these beauties. It's an inspiration just to walk into these shop(s) and imagine the master alone, at work, in his chocolate factory, preparing each gorgeous chocolate. Then there is that first bite. It's like falling in love for the first time - sweet, heady, rich and beautiful.Christophe Artisan Chocolatier-Patissier375 N.

<body>A new cookbook is making it possible to serve up a little Charleston flavor from kitchens near and far. “Charleston Chef’s Table,“ the sophomore effort from the Holy City’s grand gourmand, Holly Herrick, features profiles and recipes from more than 60 acclaimed restaurants. Her first cookbook, “Southern Farmers Market Cookbook,“ was published in 2009. 

The Le Cordon Bleu-trained chef and former food writer for the the Charleston Post and Courier has been having a love affair with Charleston’s eateries for many years now — just consider this new cookbook a testament to her ardor and a finely tuned palate that’s been years in the development. 

Herrick was in Hartsville on Jan. 26 for a book signing and cooking demo at Hobnob Gourmet. If you didn’t get a chance to sample the delicious dish she prepared that night, don’t fret — just stop by Hobnob for a signed copy of Herrick’s cookbook. Inside, you’ll find the recipe for Virginia’s She-Crab Soup, a quintessential Lowcountry delicacy featuring fresh blue crab, roe and herbs in a savory cream and butter base. Not only is it luscious, but it’s easy to make, too.

“I was thinking that people could use this cookbook in a number of different ways,“ Herrick said. “On one hand, you have the people who might not be interested in cooking but who are excited about foods. Conversely, you have those who will go to one of the featured restaurants and want to remember it and recreate it in their home. 

“Then, there are the people who really love to cook and who will get excited about creating these dishes,“ she explained. “Hopefully it will be fun for people to actually make a chowder or other dish from one of the most impressive restaurants in Charleston, to actually be comfortable and inspired by that. I wanted these recipes to be something people could easily make.“

A quick browse through the cookbook’s pages, filled with Christopher Brown’s gorgeous glossy photos of Charleston sights and dishes, reveals something unique. While Lowcountry influences are apparent throughout, there is a surprisingly distinctive array of ethnic and fusion offerings. You won’t find a dozen different interpretations of shrimp and grits here, though the beloved dish does get adequate representation. Think Chinese Chicken Salad from Cru Cafe or Guacamole Camaron from Uno Mas. The diversity is tantalizing, offering the home cook a more adventurous culinary experience. Still, there is an underlying commonality that tethers this body of recipes to Charleston tradition.

“I think that the starting point of the restaurant chefs featured in the cookbook is always to begin with the best quality — that means local produce and other ingredients regardless of what kind of food they are making,“ Herrick said. “Obviously, avocados are not grown in South Carolina; they are grown in California. However, the shrimp in the featured guacamole is local, so this dish — like most all of the dishes in the cookbook — is inspired by the Lowcountry. ... Thank God Charleston chefs put an emphasis on using foods that are local, fresh and sustainable.“

Suzanne Galloway, owner of Hobnob Gourmet, says she has both of Herrick’s cookbooks in stock. The cookbooks are also available through local and online booksellers.

Hobnob Gourmet is located at 113 W Carolina Ave., Hartsville. Call and reserve a copy of the cookbook at (843) 857-4681. For more information on Holly Herrick, visit http://www.hollyherrick.com.</body></row>

<body>As South Carolina’s cruise industry expands, some worry more ships and people could hurt the charm of Charleston that draws visitors in the first place.
?  ?  
The South Carolina Coastal Conservation League is suggesting officials approve rules to further regulating the industry.

State Ports Authority spokesman Byron Miller says the agency wants to work with others on a task force to address concerns.
?  ? 
Miller says cruises are a small but important part of tourism and it’s important the business complements Charleston’s atmosphere.

He notes Key West, Fla., a major cruise center, will have more than 400 port calls this year. Charleston will have only 67.</body></row>

Paul Rudd will be in the hot seat at the next installment, and we hope he gets asked about his stint as Planet Earth on Sesame Street?s eco-special, possibly the best famous person-and-puppets cameo since Prince played ?Raspberry Sorbet? on The Muppet Show.

<body>Relative unease
Cops were called to a Mill Street home in Red Hook after a young woman struck her mother in the head with a frying pan.
Officials said that the 21-year-old was arguing with the family matriarch at 3:20 p.m. on January 2 when she picked up the pan and started swinging.
Her mother reportedly lost a tooth after the pan, which was on a stove burner, struck her square in the face. The woman also suffered a burn to her leg when the pan struck her there.
Cops took the 21-year-old into custody without incident, charging her with assault. Her mother was taken to Long Island College Hospital for treatment.
Prying crime
A Fourth Place resident returned home last week to find that someone had tried to pry his way into her apartment.
The woman told police that she left the home, located between Clinton and Henry streets, at 6 p.m. on January 9. When she returned at 9 a.m. the following the morning, she discovered several pry marks on her door and entryway.
The lock on the door wasn’t breached, officials said. 
Jewelry removed
An 86-year-old man lost an assortment of bling when a thief visited his Baltic Street home on January 7.
The senior said he returned to his apartment near Henry Street at 9 a.m. only to discover that some items had been removed from his closet.
About $300 in gold jewelry was among the missing items, said cops, who were investigating if the thief had entered the apartment through a fire escape window even though the senior said that he had closed and locked the window before leaving.
Marshaling fraud
A brazen flim flam artist is being sought for stealing money from the City Marshal’s office.
Workers at the City Marshal’s Brooklyn headquarters on Court Street said that someone had managed to duplicate a check meant for an employee and then cashed the check, taking nearly $6,000 from their coffers.
The fraud was discovered on January 6, officials said.
Nicotine trigger
Two thieves held up a 57-year-old man at gunpoint after asking him if he had a cigarette to spare.
The victim told police that he was passing Smith and 9th streets as he made his way home from a neighborhood deli at 1:30 p.m. on December 30 when he realized that someone was keeping pace with him.
A few seconds later, the man asked if the victim had a cigarette.
When he went into his pocket to retrieve one, the stranger pulled a gun, closed the distance between them and ordered him to hand over his money.
The gunman was soon joined by two accomplices, who removed $50 and a cell phone from his pockets.
The victim managed to call 911 as the thieves fled, but no arrests had been made as this paper went to press.
Moonshine menace
A thief lifted a pocketbook from a patron at Moonshine, 317 Columbia Street last week, cops from the 76th Precinct were told.
The woman said that she left the pocketbook on a chair next to her at 1 a.m. on December 29.
She looked back a short time later, but her pocketbook was gone, said police, who added that the theft was caught on a surveillance camera.
Cops were still looking for the thief as this paper went to press.</body></row>

<body>First of all, I'd like to wish a happy first day on the job to our new mayor, Stephanie Rawlings-Blake. I don't know a whole lot about her, although this profile in today's Sun is somewhat insightful. At the very least, I'm hoping she can resist taking gift cards intended for the poor - in that regard, the bar is low.

<body>I promise, I'm not turning this into an obituary blog! But I was reading the New York Times on Saturday and came across this small write-up. Usually, the paper features two or three short articles of notable people who have passed on; Ms. Mon Toy's obit was instead in the paid section:&quot;MARY MON TOY, 93, died on December 7, 2009 in her beloved New York City. A triple threat: Latin Quarter showgirl; original Broadway cast member in The World of Suzy Wong and House of Flowers; on television on Kojak, Ryan's Hope, Teahouse of the August Moon, I Spy and Drs. Hospital; in movies in Airplane II and Bob Fosse's All That Jazz.She was the first Asian runway model in Paris. Born in Hawaii, her family moved to Seattle in the 1920's only to be uprooted and sent to the Minidoka Japanese American Internment Camp after Pearl Harbor. She left the camp in 1944 on a scholarship to Juilliard procured by Eleanor Roosevelt. The rest of her life was spent in New York City where she was an active member of Screen Actors Guild, AFTRA and Actors' Equity, and generous supporter of The Actors Fund, animal rights and The Japanese American National Museum.&quot;Her story caught my attention and I went look for some more information about her, to no avail. I did find a small review in a 1950 Billboard Magazine review reviewing a variety show at The Palace she was featured in, giving her faint praise:&quot;Mary Mon Toy showed a good soprano voice, smart wardrobe but little commercial pacing. After opening with This Can't Be Love, she went into Sorrento (English and Italian) and wound up with a piece from Carmen to a fairly good hand.&quot;Her biggest roles were in the original 1954 production of Truman Capote's musical House of Flowers as Mamselle Honolulu, and the 1958 Broadway debut of The World of Suzie Wong, playing the role of Minnie Ho. In the film All That Jazz, she plays a 'dietician'.You think about the thousands of performance who have come through New York in its long history as an entertainment capital; of the .01% who actually make it big; the large number who pass through without making their mark. Then you have the Mary Mon Toys, who work solidly their entire careers without breaking through.You have to admit, you cannot possibly read that charming little writeup without wanting to know more.</body></row>

<body>From M2 Ultra Lounge's website M2 Ultra Lounge may not get a second chance from the DOH. After yesterday's tribunal hearing, the city is vowing to close at least one of the five clubs brought forth to defend themselves for violating the Smoke-Free-Air Act. Lawyer Thomas Merrill told the Daily News &quot;We made it clear we will go forward and we are not interested in making a deal.&quot; Though all five clubs are in danger of getting their licenses revoked, M2 is apparently the worst violator.

The Imperial reportedly may agree to pay thousands of dollars in fines and get one more chance to stop people from lighting up inside, and Southside Night Club, The Box and Lit Lounge all got more time to prepare their cases and will return next month. But M2 may have to close. The city's testimony included photos of bouncers chatting with smokers and evidence of cigarettes for sale in the bathroom. 

M2's lawyer insists that cigarette sales were not sanctioned by the owner and that &quot;we make a good-faith effort to stop smokers, but it's almost impossible to stop everyone.&quot; Impossible! Especially when the owner doesn't even try to kick people out, as he admitted yesterday. But wait, if M2 goes down, where will Justin Dior Combs hold his 17th birthday party?</body></row>

<body>Reaching in to the Slice mailbag, we've got a great email that really makes me enjoy blog-blabbing. Mike here was one of the tens of thousands of folks who discovered Slice when the Yahoo homepage linked to our Domino's new recipe review last week.



I just read your article on the &quot;new Domino's Pizza.&quot; I have seen the commercials for the &quot;new&quot; pizza pies. I have yet to try them out, but I will in the near future. To be blunt, I have never, ever been a fan of Domino's. It always tasted quite crappy to me. I used to describe their pies as &quot;cardboard as the crust, water as the sauce, some foreign substance for the toppings, and paper shredding for the cheese.&quot;To be even more blunt, I am very finicky when it comes to pizza. I have a lot of folks I know that just love Papa John's. To me, Papa John's is worse than Domino's. I have had Papa John's numerous times and have never come close to being content with its product. Except for their bread sticks, and that butter sauce. The only pizza that I rank lower than Papa John's is CiCi's and maybe Chuck E. Cheese. Wow, I think a worn sock would probably taste better than those two. Poor kids have to be subjected to the pies at Chuck's?torture.

Here, in Shreveport, Louisiana, we have Domino's, Pizza Hut, Papa John's, CiCi's, and Little Caesar's...as the more major chains. We then have more regional brands like Pie Works, which is growing considerably. Johnny Huntsman's chain, Johnny's, and a couple of local joints like Smitty's.As you MAY know, Gatti's is pretty crappy now; it used to be above average. I liked it, but now I cannot stand it. I have not been to a Little Caesar's in about 15 to 18 years. I used to love getting the &quot;Big Cheese&quot;; it was a lot of pie for a small price, and it tasted darn good. I stand like most folks on the HUT. I like it, but it is surely not that good. I cannot say anything about the little local Smitty's. First off, I have not had it yet. And, it is way across town. I have found out that pizza is like a lot of other foods when it comes to most people's particular tastes. It is what they were raised on, and/or are accustomed to. Some person could have had nothing but Domino's all their life, and that is what they will MOST LIKELY, (not surely) choose as their favorite. [This is the heart of Sam Sifton's &quot;Pizza Cognition Theory.&quot; ?The Mgmt.]I am not a fan of the other cult-followed brand around here?Pie Works. See, if you do not know, this company started out quite small about 10 years ago and has grown well down here in the South. They have unique toppings, such as Rattlesnake, among other things. So, being different has caught the attention of a ton of people in the area, and they believe, in their heads, that it is the best pizza they have ever had. Maybe for them it is?but not for me and my sports-watching, movie-going, wrestling PPV?purchasing pals.For us, we have love for Mr. Huntsman's chain. Which is local. Mostly in Shreveport, Bossier City, and some of the other surrounding cities. Johnny's just has everything right. I do have my problems with them from time to time. Such as, when they rush the pies and there is almost no cheese on my pie and it tastes as bad as it looks. I eat their pies on regular basis, I know I will run into a bad pizza from there every once in a while. I am a realist. It is that the product from Johnny's is just right, the sauce has just the right amount of zing and snap to it. The crust is by far our favorite. The cheese is great regularly. The toppings always seem fresh and good. Their bread sticks are awesome; they are big, puffy, just slightly crisp on the outside and soft inside?and you have a choice of sauces, the usual pizza/marinara sauce or a medium cheddar/nacho cheese sauce.Johnny's is also known for their Muffulettas. However, I am not a fan of muffy's. All my friends seem to like them very much. The only thing that folks seem to gripe about is the prices of Johnny's. Their specialty pizzas, such as the Meat Plus, Pepperoni Plus, Hog Heaven, Maui Wowie, Bacon Cheeseburger in a 14-inch is around $17....</body></row>

<body>VANISHED The Aphrodisia Herb Shoppe has been in Greenwich Village since 1969. Yesterday it shuttered.Owner Joann Pelletiere, who had worked in the shop since the 1970s, reported 1/11 on her Facebook page, &quot;Unfortunately I am being forced to close the store on Bleecker Street at the end of January, after 35 years. Thank you for all your support and please stay in touch online.&quot;photo: Philliecasablanca's flickrThis comes soon after BookBook, formerly Biography, became their neighbor. It seemed like a good pairing--herb shop and book shop.New York describes Aphrodisia as &quot;a kind of mid-century precursor to Diagon Alley, where Harry Potter and pals might find essential ingredients for a class on the Dark Arts. There are enough culinary and medicinal herbs, curative teas, exotic spices, and vitamin supplements here to fill a shaman’s charm chest, an herbalist's apothecary, and a chef's pantry.&quot;Cool in Your Code interviewed Ms. Pelletiere on film, who remarked, &quot;We have generations coming in, children of children coming in.&quot;New York MagazineThe shop was also known for its cats, who lolled in the window on sunny mornings and were written up in The Villager: &quot;The cats are a part of the store,&quot; Pelletiere said. &quot;If people don’t see them in the window they’re very concerned. It’s neighborhood lore.&quot; But the cats will now be gone from the window, as another small, feline-friendly business is pushed out of the city.my flickrThanks to Stef for the tip and the photo of the goodbye sign, as well as the following:&quot;It was always an oasis of calm in the shop, so different from much of the mostly gentrified, tourist-choked and less-authentic neighborhood surrounding it. I chatted with Joanne a bit and she said her rent is going up from $9,000 to $18,000. She said she hoped she could find another spot and continue.&quot;Post-Script: Maybe Joann can move into the Angelica's space--which is still closed.</body></row>

<body>Can you spot the genuine iPad?
Back in July, I blogged about my then-discovery that Apple did not own the federal trademark registration for iPhone.? Needless to say, when I heard about Apple's new iPad product, I just had to see if they were out in front in securing trademark rights to this name.? They're not, at least not in the U.S.? As you may have read in the Wall Street Journal here and here, Fujitsu owns a pending U.S. trademark application for IPAD?for use in connection with &quot;hand-held computing device for wireless networking in a retail environment.&quot;? Fujitsu claims first use of the mark in January 2002.?
Apple?? Well, it appears that Apple is using a proxy  (itself a subject for a whole separate discussion) by the name of IP Application Development to secure registered rights to the IPAD trademark.? That application claims priority to a July 2009 application filed in Trinidad and Tobago.? (Trinidad and Tobago?? Another discussion topic.)
Let's see:? Marks are identical, goods are highly similar, if not identical, and priority of January 2002 versus July 2009.? Slam dunk, right?? &quot;No contest,&quot; you say?? Apple, pick again?
NOT?SO?FAST!? No, this may get interesting.? You see, Fujitsu's application to register IPAD lapsed and was declared abandoned, only to be revived in June 2009 -- a mere month before Apple's first apparent claim to rights.? This makes for a much closer race.? Further, Apple (not IP Application Development) has filed extensions of time to oppose Fujitsu's IPAD trademark application--extensions that will expire on February 28.? We should know Apple's next move within a month's time.
My assessment?? Unlike horseshoes and hand grenades, closer does not count for much here.? Priority is priority, and Apple is likely to face a difficult time surmounting some eight years of common law rights that appear to belong to Fujitsu, even if it could somehow bring down Fujitsu's application, which doesn't look promising.? (Trademark geeks see here for reason.)
Combined with the iPhone kerfuffle, I am now really wondering what Apple's trademark clearance process and discussions are like.? Selling iPods and iPhones is like printing money, so maybe Apple believes that it can just buy its way through all of these thickets.? Even so, wouldn't you want the purchase complete before the product unveiling??</body></row>

<body>Visit msnbc.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economyJames O'Keefe Charged With U.S. Senate Office Infiltration In New OrleansFour men were charged Tuesday after attempting to illegally access and manipulate the phone system in a district office of U.S. Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-Louisiana, a local U.S. attorney's office said.Joseph Basel, 24, Robert Flanagan, 24, James O'Keefe, 25, and Stan Dai, 24, were charged with entering Landrieu's New Orleans office, which is federal property, under &quot;false pretenses for the purpose of committing a Felony,&quot; according to the attorney's office.Law enforcement officials say they believe O'Keefe is the conservative activist of the same name who dressed up as a pimp last summer and visited an office of ACORN, a liberal community organizing group, in order to solicit advice on setting up a brothel, among other scenarios.He secretly recorded the visits on video and posted them on the Web, leading to a media firestorm.Flanagan is the son of William Flanagan, the acting U.S. attorney for the Western District of Louisiana, his office said.Articles on conservative Web sites connect O'Keefe to a man named Joe Basel, describing them as conservative student activists and filmmakers.According to the news release Tuesday and an affidavit by FBI Special Agent Steven Rayes, who is based in New Orleans, Basel and Flanagan attempted to gain access to Landrieu's office Monday while posing as telephone repairmen.The two men were &quot;each dressed in blue denim pants, a blue work shirt, a light green fluorescent vest, a tool belt and a construction-style hard hat when they entered the Hale Boggs Federal Building,&quot; the release said.After they entered the building, the two men told a staffer in Landrieu's office they were telephone repairmen, according to the release and Rayes' affidavit. They then asked for, and were granted, access to the reception desk's phone system.O'Keefe, who had been waiting in the office before the pair arrived, recorded their actions with a cell phone, Rayes' affidavit said.Flanagan and Basel later requested access to a telephone closet, claiming they needed to perform work on the main phone system, the release and affidavit said.According to Rayes' affidavit, the two men went to a U.S. General Services Administration office on another floor and requested access to the main phone system. A GSA employee then asked for their credentials, and the two men said they left them in their vehicle, the affidavit said.All four men have admitted their roles in the operation to federal agents, Rayes' affidavit said.If convicted, the four men would each face a fine of $250,000 and up to 10 years in prison, according to the news release.&quot;Because the details of yesterday's incident are part of an ongoing investigation by federal authorities, our office cannot comment at this time,&quot; Landrieu spokesman Aaron Saunders told CNN.Articles posted January 14 on CampusReform.org and Political Vanguard, both conservative Web sites, quoted O'Keefe and a man identified as Joe Basel as conservative student activists and independent filmmakers.&quot;Don't just respond to news, but actually create your own headlines,&quot; O'Keefe is quoted as saying by CampusReform.orgACORN Employee Sues Undercover FilmmakersThe civil lawsuit filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court in Philadelphia accuses the filmmakers of illegally recording their conversation with the worker.An employee at a Philadelphia branch of ACORN, the national community organization under fire for allegations of wrongdoing, has filed a lawsuit in federal court against the two filmmakers who set off the controversy last fall with their undercover videos.The civil lawsuit filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court in Philadelphia accuses the filmmakers, James O'Keefe and Hannah Giles, of illegally recording their conversation with the worker, Katherine Conway-Russell, and then publicizing the videos, which Conway-Russell says &quot;caused emotional distress, harm and injury.&quot;Conway-Russell is featured in one of several videos recorded by O'Keefe and Gi...</body></row>

<body>This is Michael Drebert's piece currently at Western Bridge, or part of the piece, since the piece as a whole is this ink drawing plus the action plus you imagining him doing the action plus the idea of the action (Drebert's enactment of his own Vancouver Olympics torch, basically)—but not, as in many performance works, photo or video documentation. This is it. The paper is so perfectly square and the writing so clear for what the piece actually is, which is boundless, funny, and sweet.
Ember
WB director Eric Fredericksen pointed me to another Drebert event, in 2008 at Vancouver's Artspeak. He made posters announcing his intention—the drawings always come before the actions—to make a fire using the available light in Vancouver, hoping that the light would be enough to make said fire. Evidently the police became involved. They took his poster as some kind of threat that a crime was about to break out somewhere in the city. Meanwhile, all Drebert did was make a poster, and maybe—maybe, in some small corner of the city—a tiny fire.

<body>You might think an environmentally conscious retail store called Nube Green in a hipster neighborhood and located next to a fancy baby clothier would deserve an egging. But then there is Ruth True.
True is the owner of Nube Green. She also happens to be a great collector of contemporary art, and half of the couple (Bill's the other half) behind the great SODO exhibition venue Western Bridge, which showcases their collection. But that also makes her sound like a fancy freak. In fact, she is a delightful human, and Nube Green is a cool little shop, unassuming and involving, for True, a serious learning curve. I talked to her about it yesterday.
Why did you start the store?
I went on a trip to China with Seattle Art Museum—with Mimi Gates, whose PhD is in Chinese art history; I mean, it was amazing—and it was what I didn't see. People in China have gone from starvation to now they can't breathe. They don't see blue sky, ever. And then I got back and saw our unemployment rates in this country. It's this mindlessness of Wal-Mart and lots of stuff cheap, and out of sight, out of mind.
So what are the rules for what you'll stock?
Made in the U.S., if it's fabric it's organic, or all recycled, upcycled, or if it's wood, it's sustainable, or from Urban Hardwoods—they get the wood from storms or construction sites in the city. I don't want to promote any manufacturing of new paper, new anything. Some things are like 50-percent post-consumer but they're 100-percent recyclable. That's as big as a cheat as I have.
The other name for the store should have been 'A Grain of Salt.' We've already had one person come in bitching about our lighting, that we're not green and how can we green if we leave our lights on. I'm not pretending to be perfect. Lighting is a huge can of worms. But all our lights in here are either fluorescent or recycled from an old construction project so they were already existing. So it didn't promote more manufacturing of lights but they're not all of them the lowest energy available.  
One of the reasons I love the name is because I am a newbie and I am learning, and we all are to a certain degree. Some people are so judgmental and critical that it prevents other people from entering. What I'm trying to do is just make it fun and easy. The other thing is I'm not just reselling furniture or vintage stuff. I want whatever I sell somebody had to restore or recreate it, that it created work for somebody.
What have you learned so far?
Sometimes people have something good-looking and recycled—but on top of new plywood, and the plywood industry is pretty toxic. Somebody once brought in a table made of new black walnut, he said, 'It's sustainable, it's wood,' so I did the research on black walnut, and it's like, no, black walnut takes forever to grow. Now, I do have black walnut candleholders from people like Urban Hardwoods, where if a black walnut has come down...apparently there is a big disease attacking black walnuts in Eastern Washington, so there is a bunch of reclaimed black walnut there.
I found a guy in California who works with organic cotton farmers, and there was a gal at Urban Craft Uprising who told me you can't find fabric made and milled in the U.S. Now, she's going to make a line for us using that fabric, so what that one little connection did is it supported the growers in the U.S. It's on a small scale, but you gotta start somewhere, I guess. So the networking part of it has been one of my favorite parts. It is like a scavenger hunt to find products we like that are a hundred percent made in the U.S. We do have vintage watches that weren't made in the U.S., but they've been in the U.S. a long time, and a person here has restored them, so...
Can anybody come in and show you their stuff?
Absolutely. They do it all day long.
Makers, get in touch with this woman.

<body>Tonight was my first time (back) since the (re) opening, and the kitchen was in top form!  Delicious, fresh fried oysters....unbelievably good fried Eggplant Appetizer (I could eat this every day)....Deeply rich, perfectly spicy Seafood Gumbo.....Tasso, Shrimp and cream on pasta.  I was not a believer in this last dish, but it was fantastic.  

He has a way with seafood....everything was just perfectly cooked, when so many places overcook fish, it made it all the more special.

Nice Jazz Quartet.....3 Hurricanes and a Heineken.....$85 bucks, including a 20% tip + a Five Spot for the musicians.  And, I have lunch for tomorrow.

We are two very happy, well fed customers.  Live Music, Great Food, Fantastic Time in QUEENS!!!   We'll be back, within the week.</body></row>

<body>The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation is closing in on a major settlement with insurers of the former Deutsche Bank Building near the World Trade Center site, which was damaged on Sept. 11. The tower's $200 million demolition and decontamination project has been ongoing for years, and a source told the Downtown Express that the impending settlement will call for the insurers to kick in &quot;a significant sum,&quot; though a spokesperson for the LMDC wouldn't reveal the status of the negotiations or provide a dollar figure. The insurers, Allianz Global Risks U.S. Insurance Company and AXA Corporate Solutions, were obliged to pay 75 percent of the project's costs above $45 million. That works out to roughly $113.5 million, of which they have paid just $63.5 million thus far. Demolition is expected to be completed before the end of the year, though a time line has not been set. The building was originally 40 stories tall, and workers are now taking down the 23rd floor. [Downtown Express]</body></row>

<body>Despite my belief in always sparing readers from my personal problems, the truth is there are some difficulties which are too great for me to bear alone.  One such example was a couple of weeks ago when I got sick.  Now, I find myself in need of support once again, for in &quot;curating&quot; The Great Meh BSNYC Free Scat Contest! I have been subjected to tales so woeful as to desiccate even the most exuberant soul.  Following is an excerpt from one such account, which only proves that our existence is as cruel as it is meaningless:Riding to work on a fire road at 4.30am I had coming together with a bloody big Western Red kangaroo.  I spotted the stupid bastard in my helmet-mounted-eBay-purchased-from-Hong-Kong extra sthpecial seven-candlepower light with enough time to say &quot;watchout ya stupid f*cker&quot;, it then proceeded to change direction twice before hopping and propping right in front of me.  Those bastards are hard.  And big.  Make no mistake there's no cuddling kangaroos.  I'm about 190 pounds and he had at least another 50 on me.  We both went down and somehow I ended up spooning him momentarily.  That was just before he decided to give me a swift kick in the groin.  He sprung up like nothing had happened, took his first leap using my front wheel as a trampoline and disappeared into the darkness.It only gets worse from there.  A kick to the &quot;pants yabbies&quot; from a kangaroo is bad enough, but to also lose your bike in the process is an indignity of Jobian proportions.  (That's &quot;Jobian,&quot; as in the biblical figure Job, and not &quot;Jobstian,&quot; as in serial retrogrouch and uber-curmudgeon Jobst Brandt.  Jobstian stories are generally Bunyanesque tall tales involving things like sealing tires with spoiled milk and extruding MA2 rims in the forest with your teeth.)  By the way, if you doubt the validity of the kangaroo story, I was also suspicious.  However, I did some checking, and it turns out the submission comes from Australia.  As it happens, Australia is the pretty much the only place in which Western Red kangaroos--or really any kangaroos--are found in the wild (though I think there may also be some in New Guinea, home of the penis gourd), and this is a little-known fact of which the average confidence artist would be unlikely to be aware.  Also, if you're wondering what kind of person rides to work on a fire road at 4:30am, do keep in mind that he is Australian, so he's probably just your typical accountant or other white collar professional.  There are very few actual paved roads and buildings &quot;Down Under,&quot; and most people live and work in hollowed-out trees.  Moreover, they live in constant terror of kangaroos, and so they tend to commute before dawn under cover of darknessDespite my immense sympathy for the victim, though, please know that he is not necessarily going to win the Scattante.  I merely wanted to give readers a taste of the bitter tonic I must constantly imbibe, and at this point the Scattante is still very much &quot;up for grabs.&quot;  However, I would like to stress that whoever does win the Scattante should emphatically not equip it with this &quot;book caddy&quot; from Performance, which was brought to my attention by a number of readers:I should not have to point out that reading while cycling is extremely dangerous--more so even than listening to music.  This is something I can say from experience, because while I mentioned the other day that I crashed into a beer truck this past summer, what I did not include was the fact that I was reading Cormac McCarthy's &quot;The Road&quot; at the time.  This is a book that is as pants-yabbies-twistingly emotional as it is engrossing, and it's both Jobian and Jobstian.  Anyway, there I was, riding and crying, and before I even had a chance to insert a bookmark to hold my place I found myself flying over the handlebars of my Empire State Courier and Euro-kissing the Bud Light logo like an overly-amorous podium girl.Speaking of how not to use your Scattante, while I really have no control over what the winner does with it, I would implore him or her not to use it for epicurean adventures.  No, t...</body></row>

<body>Inmate and disbarred lawyer Lynne Stewart has been selected by WBAI listeners to serve on the station's board of directors, even though she doesn't even have access to a radio. The 70-year-old civil-rights fighter was sentenced to 28 months in prison for helping a radical Islamic leader she represented smuggle messages to his followers in Egypt. Stewart claimed she was being a &quot;zealous advocate&quot; for her client, Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, nonetheless she was found guilty of conspiracy and providing material support to terrorists. 

The activist has support in WBAI, 99.5 FM, founded by pacifist Lew Hill. In September the station held a fundraiser for Stewart and now the New York Post reported listeners have chosen her to serve on the station's board through an online poll. It's still unclear how she'll fulfill her duties but according to her website , she's working on getting FM reception.</body></row>

<body>Good Afternoon, Kittens.   Here it is almost Go Home Time and I *finally* have a moment to fill you in on my life.   Yesterday, I had a conversation with a manager who instructed me to do something which I felt was slightly unethical.  I still did it (because I was told to); however, I am keeping records and my name is not on the project.  I don't think anything will come of it, but it made me feel slightly icky.    After work, I met Mr. Fantastic for dinner.  We went to Ulah Bistro on U Street.  I had the white bean vegetarian burger.  Nom.  And a martini.  And a glass of wine.  Tasty.  Although I was tempted to go back to his place for a bit, I had to head home.  Lots of things to do there.    I let the Guest Kitteh out of his room for awhile.  I checked email.  I washed dishes.  I contemplated various outfits for work today.  I *ahem* packed an overnight bag, and, then, I went to bed.   This morning, the nationwide manager of my program came for a site visit.  He and another gentleman helped me set up a database, which -once I learn to use it properly- will be very very helpful.  They were quite informative and friendly, but I was still a bit stressed out during their visit.    They left around 2:30 and I breathed a huge sigh of relief.  *SIGH*   Tonight, I am heading over to Mr. Fantastic's apartment for a little sleepover.  Should be a fun time.  SCGB has promised to visit my apartment to spend some quality time with the kittehs tonight.  He's so awesome.    And, it's supposed to snow tonight.  I wonder if it will?   Have a great rest of your day!  *smooches*</body></row>

<body>Since the name Foul Swoops started appearing on bills with local bands we know and like, such as Hume, S PRCSS and The Coathangers, we'd been anxiously awaiting a chance to check them out for ourselves. Upon finally catching their most recent gig, it's clear that they have their priorities straight: songwriting. Foul Swoops's songs layer simple but effective pop melodies in front of plenty of guitar fuzz. When combined with male and female vocal interplay, it's easy to tell that this group has spent time with some old Comet Gain records. 

Brothers Sean and Devin Connell don't hesitate to switch between drums and guitar, depending on the song. They're clearly a talented group who care about the basics of quick, clean pop/rock creations in a way that draws from bands like The Clean and sound equally timeless. Even this early in their music career, they seem to have the right idea. 

DCist sat down with the (now) trio from Arlington on drummer/guitarist Devin Connell's 21st birthday. We talked to the brothers and bassist Emilio Chavarria about their favorite Pavement releases, getting lost on the University of Maryland's campus, Arlington gentrification and why they like cassette tapes. 

Find them online: myspace.com/foulswoops

See them next: Tonight at the Velvet Lounge 		 			 				 	 	 	Have you guys known each other for awhile?

Sean: I’ve known [Devin] 21 years to the day, actually. And Emilio and Devin are friends from high school. 

Devin: We all went to Wakefield.

Sean: He played baseball and I played baseball. 

Have you guys been playing music together since high school, or is this a new thing?

Sean: Devin and I have always played. It was just a matter of finding the right person for awhile.

Devin: It took forever.

Sean: Emilio was willing. We played with some other people, too. 

I’ve seen you play with more than the three of you onstage. 

Sean: Well, Diana was actually the first member of the band, besides me and Devin. She actually came before Emilio but she’s gone to Switzerland for a few months. So, she’s not currently in the band, but, we’re soldiering on. 

I realize that I’m catching you guys at a pretty early stage.

Sean: Yeah, we haven’t released anything, but we are recording. We’re hoping to put out a 7” soon. Like, in the very near future. 

When are you hoping that will come out?

Sean: By the spring. Early spring. We have a batch of songs, it’s just a matter of recording it. Because we prefer to do it all ourselves. Just a matter of getting together and getting it pressed. 

Devin: We have the songs, it’s just a matter of figuring it all out. 

Who’s pressing it?

Sean: We’ve got a couple of friends, luckily, who like what we do and they’re trying to push it. They know the people. We just write the songs, doing the music. Other people are like, “Man, we want to help you put out a 7”.” We’ll learn from them as they show us. There’ll be a record label in the future somewhere, once we come up with a name. That’s our main goal is to do it ourselves, push it ourselves, mix it ourselves. We love cassettes. That’s what we record on.

Devin: We record on a four track. And then we’ll bounce it off to a mixer or an eight track or something. But mostly we use a four track. 

Sean: We’ve had talks about starting a cassette label. Just cassettes. 

Devin: So bring back the cassette player. 

Who has been helpful in this process?

Sean: David Malitz has been pretty helpful. He’s a friend who was a friend through a friend who really likes the band. We’re all Wizards fans. The fact that we all have boy crushes on Gilbert Arenas as much as we do on Stephen Malkmus is what brought us together. Aaron Leitko of the City Paper is really cool, too. He’s given us a bunch of shout outs and stuff. They’ve been helpful. My friend Meg Zamula has been really helpful. She introduced me to The Clean, and that’s good enough. We just have supportive people that have been around music longer than us. 

I noticed some of the Clean in your sound, which is never a bad thing.

Sean: No, definitely not. Probably le...</body></row>

<body>In the two weeks since Haiti was hit by a devastating earthquake, we?ve been keeping a list of happy hours and concerts that benefit relief organizations. Many of these events have been one-time affairs. But now we?re seeing an increasing number of regularly occurring events pledging to give some proceeds to help Haitians. Here are a few of the new ones we?ve added. Through Valentine?s Day, Vinoteca will give 15 percent of its total happy hour sales to the Clinton-Bush Haiti Relief Fund as part of its Happy Hour for Haiti. Vinoteca already had one of our favorite happy hours out there -- 20 different wines by the glass for $5 each and discounted snacks and appetizers -- so knowing that some of your dollars are doing good makes it that much better. Now that the wine bar has expanded happy hour to Mondays, you can get the deal every</body></row>

at one of the fine restaurants in town because you can’t get into your
favorite (I hear D-Bar has reserved all three seatings already), make
duck breast for your paramour. I’ll just throw it out there – duck is a
sexy meat. It is even sexier when it is prepared medium rare with spicy
berbere and tangy pomegrate glaze.</body></row>

<body>St. John’s Bread and Life, Brooklyn’s largest emergency food provider, will host a Pre-Valentine’s Day event to encourage those in the Brooklyn community to have a heart for hunger. Chef Abigail Hitchcock will host the fundraiser at her establishment, Abigail Café &amp; Wine Bar, located at 807 Classon Avenue in Prospect Heights on February 10, 2010 from 6:30 – 9 p.m. Wine from Abigail’s award winning selections and hors d'oeuvres will be served. There will also be raffles for the chance to win great prizes including an espresso machine, a basket of wine and a basket of lotto tickets.
This informal &quot;friend raiser&quot; and informational event will underscore the crisis of hunger in underserved neighborhoods in Brooklyn. This year 1 in 5 New Yorkers will use emergency food pantries and soup kitchens. Visits to Bread and Life are up 70% compared to last year, due to the ongoing recession. Though demand for social services is up, cash donations were down 12% in 2009.
“One of the reasons Brooklyn is so unique is our strong feelings of community pride. We’re building on that and making a concerted effort to encourage our Brooklyn neighbors to take part in what we do here in the community,” said Anthony Butler, executive director of St. John’s Bread and Life.  “Plus, as part of Brooklyn Community Foundation’s ‘Give Where You Live Campaign,’ every ticket purchased will be matched, furthering the cause to help our neighbors who are struggling.” 
Every year Bread and Life delivers more than 400,000 meals and procures more than $1 million in assistance to help individuals and families combat hunger.</body></row>

<body>Produced in part by the fine folks at SPUR (San Francisco Planning &amp; Urban Research Association), this map indicates POPOS (Privately Owned Public Open Spaces). Many of them, it seems, are not visited nearly enough. 

Strange Maps reports:

Scattered across the centre of San Francisco are almost seventy semi-secret spaces, privately owned but open to the public. Subject to the fine print of a little-known pact between City and Commerce, these so-called POPOS (Privately Owned Public Open Spaces) allow alluring vistas of San Francisco and access to its intimate interiors. However, they are often poorly indicated - perhaps a deliberate tactic by the private companies who own the spaces to prevent the pesky public from using them. Accessing POPOS sometimes even requires walking past security guards, or through unmarked doors. No wonder many are under-frequented.

The round indicators are spaces set up between 1959 and 1985, the squares denote the 23 &quot;inaugurated after the 1985 Downtown Plan, which stipulated the zoning regulations requiring commercial urban development to be counterbalanced by POPOS.&quot;

Comprehensive information about POPOS history and regulations can be found here. Strange Maps also details each park for your convenience. Read more about said POPOS after the jump.  		 			 				 	 	 	1. Redwood Park: An urban park at the foot of San Francisco’s most striking skyscraper with redwoods, sculptures and a fountain.

<body>On a good day, Anthony Lucas of Anthony’s Cookies bakes up to 4,000 cookies—that’s a lot of dough. Until Oprah’s announcement that she was canceling her show, we half-expected the charming and ebullient entrepreneur to show up on one of her easy chairs. Though his shop on Valencia Street, decorated simply with Straus milk bottles, is not far from Humphry Slocombe and Dynamo Donut, you won’t find any bacon or fleur de sel in these sweets—the flavors are classic, from peanut butter (the recipe for which he says was the hardest to perfect) to cookies-and-cream (our personal favorite) to toffee chip. What began only last spring as a side business for Lucas while he pursued an accounting degree at San Francisco State has grown—he now sells his cookies to Gap corporate, Rainbow Grocery, Caffe Trieste, Mixt Greens and Four Barrel Coffee, in addition to direct sales from his own off-the-beaten path storefront. “I never in my life thought I would work this hard, but it’s absolutely rewarding. When you come from the humble beginnings that I did, you appreciate every person who walks in that door,” he says. Rather than expansion though, Lucas has his sights set on perfection. “I just want to take care of my employees. I want to be known for great customer service and flawless quality. I want my cookies to be the best cookies you’ve ever eaten.” It’s safe to say he’s on his sweet way.</body></row>

<body>We've noticed two more recent closings in the heart of Union Square hotel land – both of which are billed as temporary, citing &quot;remodeling,&quot; but both of which look suspiciously permanent. We never had the pleasure of trying Sultan's gourmet Indian cuisine (340 O'Farrell), which was the higher-end, organic version of the next-door Naan &amp; Curry outpost.  		Now it looks like we may not get a chance unless the remodeling excuse turns out to be true (no evidence of remodeling could be seen and the competition next door couldn't have helped, but the place still had tables and chairs). Café.com, the dated internet café and smoothie shop whose primary clientele were the European and South American students staying at nearby hostels on Mason Street, has a sign up with a similar message, but the windows there were sprayed over, and we're guessing it will get a complete re-branding, if it reopens at all.

Named for the number of tracks, 17 is classic folksy, bluesy Americana. What listeners might not expect is the occasional reggae influences that show up on some songs. The addition of reggae is a nice touch, and it fits well with the band's overall sound. Lyrics are entertainingly messed up.

<body>World premieres are fun because you get to sit smugly with the knowledge that you're one of the first people on the planet to see whatever it is you're seeing. We all like to be smug on occasion. Aurora Theatre is a darn good place to see such premieres, as it pulls down plenty of respect and kudos from the theater-y folks.
The First Grade, the world premiere in question, was developed at Aurora last year as part of GAP (Global Age Project) by esteemed Chicago playwright Joel Drake Johnson. The full production is now playing in conjunction with this year's GAP. The First Grade features a schoolteacher whose ex-husband still lives with her - and that's just the first of her problems. Her daughter is depressed, her grandson's on Ritalin, and her first graders are...first graders. Inescapably so. Plus, she has to rescue her physical therapist while being subjected to the indignity of bouncing therapeutically around on a large rubber ball.
Through February 28 at Aurora Theatre in Berkeley. Tickets: (510) 843-4822 or www.auroratheatre.org.

<body>Downtown Berkeley jazz club Anna’s Jazz Island closed unexpectedly last week. In an e-mailed statement (also posted on the venue’s web site), owner Anna de Leon cited issues with the developer of their larger-size venue on Allston Way — including “rowdy and disruptive events” next door at the Gaia Arts Center — as well as the desire on behalf of a new owner of the building to terminate her lease (de Leon says she accepted “an offer we couldn’t refuse”). Meanwhile, it looks like San Francisco’s Marsh Theater has found a permanent home in the Gaia Building next door to Anna’s. The theater, which has held events there in the past, tweeted nine days ago: “It's official! Marsh Berkeley will open its doors on Jan 22nd with Don Reed's &quot;East 14th!” 
The closing of Anna’s Jazz Island came about abruptly; indeed, there was no hint of problems in a recent profile on de Leon by Dave Newhouse. This may not be the end of the longstanding jazz venue, however. De Leon wrote: “We are now looking for a new space and a new partner, somebody who loves jazz, to participate in opening a new venue.” Read the full statement after the jump...

<body>While a large chunk of New Yorkers spent last week on a post-Grammy vacation in sunny, warm L.A., some out-of-towners like U2 and Sarah Silverman took advantage of our celebrity vacuum and filled it with self-promotion. After celebrating artist Damien Hirst's new exhibition at the Gagosian Gallery over the weekend, U2 band members dispersed across the city, dining with various attractive women: Bono at Da Silvano with a group of leggy blondes, the Edge at Morandi with a former Victoria's Secret Angel. Sarah Silverman, in town to promote the premiere of her show's third season, picked at some health food. Below, the week in boldfaced dining. 		Butter: Governor Paterson's endorsement of Kirsten Gillibrand didn't stop him from sitting down with Harold Ford Jr.; Ford allegedly footed the bill. [NYP]

Da Silvano: Bono and artist Damien Hirst dined with some ladies. [NYP]

Dylan's Candy Bar: Alec Baldwin, who says he needs to lose a couple, buys fudge, Swedish fish, and chocolate. [NYP]

Emporio: On Wednesday, Thomas Keller of Laundry and Per Se paid his respects. On Thursday, Matt Dillon stopped by. [Grub Street]

<body>Valentine's Day has always been sort of a pain in the ass in the city. Every mediocre restaurant in Manhattan and Brooklyn suddenly only offers $100 pre fixe menus that night, and because of poor planning on my part, we wound up eating the worst potato pancakes ever one year (and they insisted I take it home with me!). This year, we decided to skip the hassle and have V-day early. But where to go for a nice but moderately priced meal? It's nice that New York's best acclaimed chefs have already thought of that, providing restaurants that us  normal people can visit without breaking the bank. Daniel Boulud has DBGB Kitchen &amp; Bar,  Danny Meyer has Shake Shack,  and Jean Georges has (among many other lesser priced places) Nougatine. Since we're not going to eat cheeseburgers in the park in the middle of February (well, at least not in the name of love), Nougatine it was.Nougatine is only separated from Jean Georges by two 15-foot high doorways, and they share the same kitchen. While Jean Georges looks very formal, Nougatine has more of a relaxed atmosphere. We arrived a bit early and started with drinks at the bar: a bubbly champagne for me and an off-dry Reisling for him.Most restaurants offer at least some sort of options in their tasting menus, but Nougatine's is very set; it includes two pre-chosen appetizers, two entrees and a dessert tasting menu. It didn't make sense for both of us to get the same thing (it'd be way too much food anyway), so Rob got the tasting menu and I got the lobster to maximize our tasting experience.The amuse-bouche was a scallop with julienned (and pickled?) green apples and a lime leaf on top. The scallop was tender and soft, contrasted in texture by the apple. The taste of the mint shined on. It was served with a warm shot of celery root and apple soup. Believe it or not, this was maybe my favorite part of the entire meal. Maybe next time I can get a plate of 20 scallop-spoons and soup shots?First appetizer: tuna tartare with avocado, spicy radish and ginger marinade. Probably one of the best tuna tartares I've ever had, and pretty unusual too. Rob's discerning taste buds caught on to a flavor normally experienced in pumpkin pies. Nutmeg, maybe? The layers of radish slices on top gave texture to the dish that otherwise just melts in your mouth. (Sorry for the bad picture and the poor ones to come. There was a man sitting next to us with a huge lip from  many years of pouting. He was staring at me strangely. It flustered me.)Next appetizer: the foie gras brulee. It seems like they pureed the foie gras, since it was super creamy, and positioned it on top of a biscuit-type thing before blasting it with heat to make the brulee crust everyone loves. Served with a tart bowl of pineapple meyer-lemon jam.Now the entrees... none of which were as good as anything that came before it. Especially the lobster, which was super disappointing for me. The lobster was deep fried, which, it turns out, sucks out all the flavor. The topping -- butter cabbage, ginger and lots of jalapeno peppers-- masked any flavor I could have tried to get otherwise. And there was a lot of it, too -- three tails, two claws maybe? By the end I was hoping never to see cabbage again. Let's leave the fried food with jalepeno peppers to the bars and strip malls.Somewhere around this point in the meal I was out of champagne and decided to make a smart move and get something non-alcoholic. In this case it was a black cherry yuzu soda that they make at the bar. It was a bit syrupy, but it kicked ass over any other cherry soda I've ever had. If you like the Japanese citrus, I'd recommend this fizzy drink.The red snapper with broccoli raab was topped at the table with a sweet garlic-lemon broth -- reminded me of Le Bernadin. This was very tasty with a good, crunchy top -- I only had a bite or two as I was too busy hacking away at my spicy cabbagey lobster.Next, the pan seared beef tenderloin with miso butter and roasted baby brussel sprouts. This dish was really rich, and the beef almost tasted a bit gamey (maybe it was the odd paring w...</body></row>

<body>From March 5-7, Brooklyn goes country with the Brooklyn Winter Hoedown, shining a spotlight on the borough''s bustling country scene.That annual event, now in its sixth year, is just one of many pulling from the wealth of local country bands. Here's the breakdown of some of the key players in the Brooklyn scene: The man: Dock OscarWeb site: www.kingscountyopry.com Band: The Ambassadors of Love, a full pedal, old-syle string band Main event: The Brooklyn Winter Hoedown, next up this March 5-7 at Superfine in DUMBO, featuring Greg Garing, The American String Conspiracy, The Ambassadors of Love, Alex Battles, and more Why he does it: “I’m more of a bluegrassy person. I wanted to give a shout-out to the great bluegrass and old time fiddle bands.”The man: Alex Battles Web site: www.brooklyncountrymusic.com Band: The Whiskey Rebellion, a country-folk music outfit Main event: Brooklyn Country Music Festival (the sixth annual was at Southpaw in Park Slope last September, so look out for that this fall); also organizes the yearly Cash Bash, with the 78th birthday celebration happening this Friday, February 26 at Southpaw, featuring the Whiskey Rebellion and Sister &amp; the Sisters (sold out - we warned you!). Why he does it: “I’m always trying to find out who the new kids are, who the young guns are.” The man: JD DuarteWeb site: www.brooklyncountry.comBand: The Newtown Gang. Like their 1920s namesake, they're rooted firmly in the stealth-outlaw tradition Main event: Brooklyn County Fair. A quarterly event, mark your calendars for the spring installment, March 21 at Spike Hill, featuring the Doc Marshalls, The Newtown Gang, and moreWhy he does it: &quot;I visit clubs locally and do my best to reach out for bands I have never heard before to get them involved with the festival and the Web site.&quot;</body></row>

<body>What happened to the Geek-In-Chief? The man who grew up with the Apollo moon landings- going where no man has gone before? President Barack Obama’s 2010 Budget effectively ends man in space beyond low earth orbit for the foreseeable future by axing NASA’s return to the moon program, Constellation. The program was criticized by the Augustine Commission as being ‘unsustainable’ and not on target for being mission-ready by it’s 2020 deadline.?I agree with Michael Griffin, former administrator of NASA. You can say anything is unsustainable if you don’t fund it. Some numbers for you. Apollo in adjusted dollars, over a ten year period (’62 through ’72) cost 150 billion, or 15 billion a year. Constellation, costing 9 billion over 6 years, has cost about a 10th of that- 1.5 billion a year. I’m surprised they got as far as they did, in that there wasn’t a strong mandate to do so.?At any rate, the new NASA budget, pending approval, actually increases monies to the agency over last year to support a  greater focus on solar system research, robotics, in-situ fuel manufacture, education and outreach. As far as manned space exploration, it extends the life of the ISS, and looks to private industry to develop the crew vehicles to get there (as we’ll not have a ride after the shuttle is mothballed).  Elon Musk’s Space X Corp.’s Dragon vehicle is looking promising, but that won’t be ready until 2016 (maybe). In the meantime, we go a-begging to the Russians or maybe even the Chinese for a seat.?But it’s all earth orbit. What we’ve been doing for 40 years now, after our initial flirtation with the moon. We’ll have to see how far NASA’s new reliance on private industry will get us. We’ll pop-gun back into orbit surely, but my worry is that with no clear goals and objectives for man in space, and NASA not providing systems architecture and integration (what they are very good at), any attempt at having private industry organize multi-faceted manned exploration missions to the moon or beyond is improbable any time soon.</body></row>

<body>Tia Scott has been told over and over throughout her career to be more aggressive offensively. The Spellman guard was hearing the same thing against Aquinas from coach Jane Morris when she passed up two fast break layups with late passes to teammates that didn’t result in points. 
But Scott hasn’t needed to fill up the scoring column of late as the Pilots have won nine straight with her many times collecting more assists than points. That was the case again in a 61-43 win over host Aquinas in CHSAA Bronx/Westchester girls basketball Tuesday. Scott had just three points, but seven assists. Her job, though, has been making all of Spellman players a threat and getting them to fit together. 
“I’ve tried to make them more comfortable with me,” Scott said. “I’m trying to adjust to their game more than them adjusting to mine.”
Added junior guard Amber Griffin: “Whoever is open she passes to them. They have to be ready for the ball.”
Troi Melton scored 19 points and grabbed eight rebounds and Griffin added 12 points, 12 rebounds and four blocks for Spellman (15-3, 7-1). Jo-Marie Aquino had nine points and Cari English added nine. Danielle Raikes led Aquinas (5-6, 5-6) with 11 points and Sade Jackson added 10.
“We have five to six people who can play,” Melton said. 
She, Scott and Griffin, who also play together with New Heights, have been the constants for the Pilots. Melton has followed up her breakout sophomore season with a consistent junior campaign and has shown an improved jump shot. Scott missed most of last year with Achilles tendonitis, but is a sure ball hander with break down speed and a high basketball IQ. 
&quot;Everybody is contributing in their own way,” Scott said
The 5-foot-9 Griffin and her freakish athleticism has helped her emerge as a force on both sides of the ball now that she is playing under the basket. She was moved to guard last season with injuries to Spellman’s starting backcourt. She can knock down the midrange jumper and is like a pogo stick fighting for rebounds, going up second and third times. 
“I always felt I was good on defense,” Griffin said. “I’ve always been able to block shots and get steals. I felt like a needed to step up offensively and just show that it is my time to shine.”
Added Morris: “The last couple of games she is coming up with baskets when we are in a dry spell.”
Since coming back from Christmas break Spellman has lost just once to Maria Regina. Two of its three losses are to CHSAA Brooklyn/Queens squads Mary Louis and St. Francis Prep early in the season. During its winning streak, it has cleaned up its turnovers, is boxing out more and is shooting better from the free throw line. 
Juniors Laura McCaffrey and English stepped in of injury seniors Asia Strickland and Julia Blasi, who recently returned to action. McCaffrey has given them a solid outside threat. English, along with Aquino, adds extra size and rebounding down low and the ability to finish around the rim. The Pilots' length and athleticism allows them to be active in the passing lanes. 
“Turnovers really hurt us,” Aquinas guard Danielle Raikes said.
Spellman's solid play currently has it in first place in the division, a game ahead of Maria Regina. The Pilots have won all six of their games against Staten Island opponents this season and could be the top seed in the Archdiocesan Class A playoff if it wins out. That would have to include victories over defending champ Moore Catholic and Maria Regina to end the regular season. 
“The only thing in our minds is to win,” Melton said. “We want to get as far as possible.”

<body>Late in December, the New York State Department Of Environmental Conservation sent around a letter to local residents announcing that action would begin on January 11th,  that would address the contamination at the Gowanus Whole Foods Market site along 3rd Street.January came and went.If there was any cleaning action going on, it was not apparent.  Until this week.On Tuesday morning, I happened to walk by and saw a crew weed-whacking, chipping branches and clearing the lot.This is not exactly the environmental clean-up that was announced by the N.Y. City Environmental Conservancy, but, hey, its a start.The approximately 2.15 acre site is situated in the Gowanus Canal area, one of the most toxic places in the city. Over a century, it has been contaminated with a plethora of industrial waste from a former coal yard and petroleum oil company and freight company.Under the Brownfield Clean-Up Program, Whole Foods &quot;will receive tax credits to offset the cost of performing cleanup activities and for redevelopment of the Site.&quot;The Whole Foods project has seen little action since 2006, when the national organic food purveyor announced that it was planning to build an approximately 77,000 square foot footprint commercial building housing a supermarket, along with a total of 414 parking spaces, including a 3 level parking garage.The store was tentatively supposed to open in 2008.Related reading:Gowanus Whole Foods Site Clean-Up Action To Begin In Early January 2010For Home Page, click   Pardon Me For Asking</body></row>

<body>A large number of Yelp Elite members got sick after an event called Pley in Santa Clara, either from food poisoning or from a quickly spreading virus, as Uptown Almanac reports. Everyone from Christina G. to Amanda G. exchanged theories as to the cause, recounted each miniature dish they consumed, and compared notes on their gastro-intestinal distress. The most likely culprit appears to be a popular pulled pork slider, although no one is ruling out the &quot;crispy pork pita pocket thing&quot; or the pork tenderloin from Pampas in Palo Alto (there were apparently many vendors present who were trying to woo the Yelpers with pig).  		Nonetheless, between bouts of vomiting, Valerie G. wants everyone to know it was all worth it: &quot;BY NO MEANS AM I TRYING TO RUIN THE REVIEWS OF HOW ABSOLUTELY GREAT THIS PARTY TRUELY WAS..HOWEVER..(I had an amazing time and I love you yelp).&quot; That there is devotion, kids.

He?s got a new album coming out March 2: ?Scratch My Back,? an all-cover disc featuring Gabriel backed by a full orchestra on tracks originally recorded by everyone from Bowie to Bon Iver, which apparently is the first installment in a series Gabriel has planned of ?song exchanges,? wherein he swaps tracks with other artists. (You can hear him discuss the concept, and excerpts from ?Scratch,? including his cover of David Bowie?s ?Heroes,? here.) And tour dates in support of the collection are not far behind. This won?t be just any show, either: He?ll be supported onstage by a 54-piece (that?s fifty-four) orchestra. Tickets to his two NYC shows, at Radio City  Music Hall on May 2nd and 3rd, go on AmEx presale this Sunday, February 7 at 10AM (general sale to the public then kicks in on February 16 at 10AM).

<body>It's begun to sink in that the former Limelight nightclub, housed in an old Gothic church in Chelsea, will reopen as a shopping center.  As tenants slowly filter in, word on the street says the Limelight Marketplace will be open by March 25, as planned. The Limelight Marketplace has opted for the slow and steady route to occupy its 25,000-square-foot, four-story bazaar modeled on a European village, avoiding any flea market association with high end shops from Hunter to J. Sisters to Sweet Room.  On the food front, things couldn't be better, with outposts of S'Mac and Grimaldi's moving in.  Apparently, there are still spaces to fill, which the Limelight reps are attributing to their selection process.  All's a go for March 25, but we'll be interested to see how it all shakes out.</body></row>

<body>Can the rundown Loew's Theater at 31 Canal Street make a comeback? Originally opened in 1927, it was run by Loew's until the 1960s. It then became an indie-run theater until 1980. Now, the NY Post reports, it may have another lease on life, as an Asian-American arts group (CREATE: the Committee to Revitalize and Enrich the Arts and Tomorrow's Economy) hopes to revive it. 

The 2,300-seat theater has been sealed off, but now the arts group has the backing of building owner Thomas Sung to move forward with their plan for a cultural arts center. On top of Sung's support, the Lower Manhattan Development Corp. gave the group a $150,000 grant to study the project, with another $140,000 promised for planning.

The theater, aside from being stripped of its seats, is still in good shape with the its ornate terra cotta design intact. City Councilmember Alan Gerson told the Villager: “It would be the first theater opening in Chinatown in over a generation, probably several generations. It’ll bolster the arts and culture of Chinatown and it will also bolster the economy.”</body></row>

Latomie Del Paradiso
Latomie from the Greek litos – a stone 
Temnos – a cut
 
An ancient quarry in Sicily that supplied blocks of limestone for the construction of public buildings and grand houses-- 
 
Quarrying was initiated after a suitable site was selected on the grounds that it might yield regular, good-quality blocks of stone. Crevices were made in the bedrock into which wooden wedges were inserted: these were dampened to make them expand, causing the rock to split. In the search for layers of compacted rock, the quarriers would excavate funnel-like tunnels that gradually broadened out the deeper they were dug. Pillars of rock would be left to prop up the ceilings of these hollows. 
 
Once the quarry was exhausted, the cavities were be used as prisons, as described by Cicero in his Verrine Orations. It is highly probable that the 7,000 Athenian prisoners captured in the great sea battle of 413 BC were held there. All of these perished, save for a few who were lucky enough to be sold as slaves or those who, according to legend, were able to recite verses by Euripides from memory.

One of the underground galleries is named &quot;The Ear of Dionysios&quot; (l'Orecchio di Dionisio) because of its acoustics. According to legend, the tyrant Dionysios could stand at one end and hear conversations whispered between prisoners at the other. 
 
The roof of earth over the quarry collapsed in the 1693 earthquake opening it to the sky. Huge hollows and caves remain. The exposed area is now a garden planted with orange and olive trees. A February visitor finds it intoxicatingly sunny and redolent of citrus.

<body>The five nominees come from Italy, Spain, France, Germany and Chile, and only Spanish director Pedro Almodovar and Italy's Giuseppe Tornatore have seen previous films get nominated before. Both walked away winners.
Tornatore, who won in 1990 for his &quot;Cinema Paradiso,&quot; is back this year with &quot;Baaria,&quot; a film that looks at three generations in the life of a Sicilian family
Almodovar's &quot;Broken Embraces,&quot; starring Penelope Cruz, fuses a neo-noir style with a sprawling tale of dangerous love. The director has earned foreign language nominations for five of his films in the past, and he won for &quot;All About My Mother&quot; and &quot;Talk to Her.&quot;
&quot;Although I've received nominations before and I've even won Golden Globes in the past, every new nomination comes to me as a big and pleasant surprise,&quot; he said in a statement.
While Almodovar is well-known and &quot;Cinema Paradiso&quot; proved to be a crowd pleaser in the United States, all the other nominated films come from directors who have never received a Golden Globe before and will be looking to boost the recognition of their work for U.S. audiences.
The Golden Globes, given by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, are annually one of most-watched awards shows on TV, although 2009's program drew the second-lowest total viewers since 1995 with an audience of 14.6 million.
Still, filmmakers looking to the show as a platform from which to promote their films, either for box offices or DVD.
A third nominee, Germany's &quot;The White Ribbon&quot; by director Michael Haneke, tells about a village on the eve of World War One, where a series of strange accidents upsets the order. The film, which won the coveted Palme d'Or at the Cannes film festival, foreshadows the fascism that would overtake Germany.
France's Jacques Audiard is up for an award for &quot;A Prophet&quot; (&quot;Un Prophete&quot;) a drama about a prison inmate of Arab descent who rises through the ranks of a Corsican crime gang. It won the runner-up Grand Prix at Cannes this year.
&quot;This nomination is, first of all, very moving for me,&quot; Audiard said in a statement. &quot;It proves that a movie can travel, that we don't just make a film for one's own country, for our 'home,'&quot; he said.
Also nominated is 30 year-old Chilean director Sebastian Silva's &quot;The Maid,&quot; a film about a domestic who has worked for a family for a couple decades.
As she begins to suffer dizzy spells, the family hires extra help to lessen her load, but she resents the goodwill gesture and zealously tries to drive off each new domestic who enters the household.
The Golden Globe Awards will be given out by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association on January 17. Last year's Golden Globe foreign language winner was the Israel's &quot;Waltz with Bashir.&quot;</body></row>

<body>If we had to guess, we'd say that chances are, no one has ever built a multi-billion-dollar hedge fund on being a nice guy. So we're not exactly surprised to find that Steve Cohen runs SAC Capital with an iron, albeit slightly doughy, fist. Cohen, who sits on the trading floor himself, keeps the temperature at SAC at 69 degrees, so no one dozes off or is otherwise comfortable. He hates noise, so the phones don’t ring, they light up. Every Sunday night, he requires his portfolio managers to call in with predictions for the week ahead for the companies they follow. And even if you manage to get through all that, you still might piss Cohen off. &quot;He was a pretty good yeller and screamer back in the day,&quot; a former colleague tells Bloomberg Markets. &quot;He ripped into everybody.&quot; Still does, apparently. 		 If a portfolio manager or analyst can’t answer a question about a stock, Cohen is likely to lash out. “Do you even know how to do this f---ing job?” is a standard barb, current and former employees say. 


But those who work at the House of Cohen are not always kept in a state of grim, cold, butt-clenching fear. There's some positive things. The money, for one. And occasionally, like an abusive husband who suddenly brings home flowers, the big guy bestows on his employees a gift. The gift of laughter.

The boss has a sense of humor that’s dry, along the lines of Jerry Seinfeld, former employees say. In September 2008, before Lehman’s bankruptcy, Cohen sent a companywide e-mail: “It’s all up to the government now. I have no idea what will happen. Good luck to you all. This is a recording.”


Hahahhaha — okay, that's enough, stop laughing. You're on the clock; this is not your time, this is Steve Cohen's time, you miserable, pathetic worm, or else we're going to have to bring out the whiteboard markers.

<body>Clothing maker Jones Apparel Group Inc. on Wednesday reported a smaller fourth-quarter loss helped by cost cuts, and said its retail business is improving.Jones, like many of its rivals including Liz Claiborne Inc. and VF Corp., has struggled as major stores have cut inventory to better match supply with demand because consumers are spending less on discretionary items. The company, whose brands include Jones New York, Nine West, Anne Klein and Easy Spirit, has cut jobs and other costs and closed about 100 stores in an effort to improve performance. Another 165 locations are set to close this year.Last week the company hired a Barbie executive from Mattel, Richard Dickson, as president and chief executive of its branded business in an effort to improve results.&quot;We are encouraged by our improved operating margins and the performance of our retail business, which was profitable in the quarter,&quot; CEO Wesley Card said in a statement. He noted that sales in stores open at least a year, a key measure of a retailer's health, rose 2% in the quarter.Jones reported a quarterly loss of $124.9 million, or $1.53 per share, down sharply from $804.9 million, or $9.86 per share, last year. Excluding one-time charges for severance and restructuring efforts and other one-time items, net income matched analysts' average estimate of 11 cents per share.Jones said aggressive inventory management helped conserve cash and boost profit margins.Revenue fell 8% to $776.7 million, falling just shy of analysts' $785 million estimate according to a Thomson Reuters poll.For the year, losses totaled $83.1 million, or $1.02 per share, down sharply from a loss of $749.4 million, or $9.04 per share, in the prior year. Revenue slid to $3.33 billion from $3.62 billion.Shares rose 50 cents, or 3.3%, to $15.82 in afternoon trading.</body></row>

<body>By Erin Barnhart. Read more Volunteering &amp; Service posts here.

::image::Last month, in response to the many requests we received from people for information on how to volunteer in Haiti, we blogged that one of the best things would-be volunteers could do today was donate money to those organizations with trained personnel already in-country and then wait for the situation on the ground to stabilize before seeking to volunteer themselves. 

As we approach the one-month anniversary of Haiti’s devastating earthquake, we wanted to give you a quick update on some of the emerging opportunities to get involved. 

Given that many organizations are still in the process of responding to immediate need while assessing longer-term recovery strategies, there are still relatively few opportunities for new volunteers in Haiti.  However, a quick search of the volunteer opportunities posted on our site turned up over 50 projects and roles for volunteers to assist with recovery efforts, both on the ground in Haiti as well as in local communities around the globe.  Here are a few examples:

Volunteering in Haiti

While opportunities to volunteer in Haiti are still being developed, there are already a handful – some providing direct service, others related to organizational needs assessments – posted on our site. Here are two that were recently posted:Visions in Action, based in Washington, DC, is seeking a volunteer for an immediate two to four week placement in Haiti.  This volunteer will coordinate VIA’s needs assessment on the ground in partnership with their Program Development Manager in DC.  Ideal candidates will have a university degree and be fluent in French and English, among other requirements.Global Volunteer Network, based in New Zealand, is developing a new volunteer program to engage people in disaster relief in Haiti.  They are currently conducting a needs assessment to determine how volunteers can best partner with local citizens and organizations but plan on sending their first group of volunteers sometime around March to help with such tasks as teaching, health and medical assistance, business development, and building and construction.  Volunteer placements will likely be from one week to six months.To find additional in-country opportunities to volunteer, search our site here.

Volunteering from Your Local Community

There are also a number of local volunteer opportunities designed to aid and assist Haitian relief efforts, from providing counseling to support local families affected by the disaster, to participating in fundraisers and remote assessment and relief projects, to serving as part of the support team to staff and volunteers currently in Haiti.  Here are some of the projects taking place in the United States (to find out what’s happening in your country, search our site here!):Assisting with post-earthquake GIS data collection and analysis with The Gadfly ProjectVolunteering as a counselor to Haitians in Boston affected by the disaster with the International Institute of BostonProviding legal assistance to Haitians seeking Temporary Protective Status in the U.S. with the New York Legal Assistance GroupSupporting in-country field workers and volunteers with Partners in HealthServing as a volunteer Public Affairs Officer with Project HOPEContributing time and expertise to graphic design, fundraising, and other tasks with the United Nations Association - Haiti.Again, these are just a few of the many ways people can volunteer to help with relief efforts in Haiti.  To discover more, search our site here. You may consider also looking for opportunities to participate in disaster response training in your local community; getting trained today means that you may be prepared to serve as a first responder in a future disaster situation.

Finally, to quote our blog post from last month, the work of recovery and rebuilding following major disasters is enormous and complex and volunteers will be needed to partner with local communities for months and years afterward.  So if you don’t see the ideal opportunity to cont...</body></row>

<body>There are presumably people out there who don't enjoy a good hotel room, but I don't know any of them. Not to get too &quot;Up In The Air&quot; on you here, but there's something about those fluffy pillows and big goofy comforters and imposingly glossy dark wood desks they don't even really expect you to use. Something kind of cool and different, yes, but also something that causes even the most virtuous carbon-footprint-watchers among us to forget ourselves and all of a sudden become the sort of people who think, &quot;well, I might as well leave the air conditioning on blast, so that it'll be nice and cool when I?return to the room in seven hours.&quot; And that -- along with a host of really dumb industry practices like leaving lights on in vacant rooms (which gets called out in the Urban Green Council's massive recent report)?-- is why hotels are some of the least-green big buildings in any city. All of which makes the news that the in-construction 36-story InterContinental Times Square hotel is pursuing LEED certification that much more welcome.
The fact that hotels generally guzzle energy at a crazy rate means that they tend to run up similarly over-the-top utilities, but the industry's surpassingly deep attachment to turbo-charged pampering has translated to a slower-than-usual response to what looks like a pretty clear mandate to step up the efficiency game. There are some pretty awesome green hotels in other cities -- here's one I?stayed at in San Francisco -- but New York is uncommonly behind the curve on this front. While there are organizations out there recognizing hotels that make an effort at sustainability, this particular sector seems far behind both the residential and office-space communities in the greening process. The Green Hotel Association -- or, as their Angelfire-looking website would have it, &quot;Green&quot;?Hotel Association -- for instance, looks a lot like a greenwasher; Green Hotel Association membership fees earn participating hotels a &quot;very comprehensive&quot;?154-page guide packed with energy saving tips and requires... well, nothing at all but a willingness to stay current on membership fees, as far as I?can tell. Maybe those quotes aren't an accident then??By the more stringent (that is to say, extant) standards of Energy Star for Hospitality certification, there are exactly two Energy Star hotels in New York City:?the Hotel Penn and New York Marriott East Side. While there are several LEED for Hospitality-certified hotels in NYC (Stephen reported on this back in 2009), the InterContinental New York Times Square promises to be the biggest green hotel in the city, and one of the greenest big hotels on the East Coast.
About that bigness:?the InterContinental Times Square is the biggest new-build hotel currently in process in the city, at 36 stories and with a whopping 607 guest rooms. Sustainability at that size is a matter of degrees, but with the exception of some generally cosmetic solar paneling, the InterContinental's green aspects seem pretty impressive:?a green roof with low solar heat gain, sustainable finishes, copious daylighting and, most intriguingly, an energy-generating elevator system. Green hosptitality as a movement has a ways to go, and it will take more than daylighting to counter the way that basic green instincts that abandon us when we leave our apartments and enter hotel rooms, but it's at least nice to see the InterContinental New York Times Square giving it a shot.

<body>You may never have heard of the name Jens Quistgaard, but if you've coveted a bright enamel pot or bulbous peppermill from Danish design company Dansk, then you have this man to thank. As the chief designer behind the brand for over 30 years, Quistgaard was responsible for the iconic style associated with Dansk, and his creations continue to gain in popularity even after his recent death at the age of 89.
This Thursday at DWR in Potrero Hill you have a chance to learn more about the man behind Dansk designs, as they will be screening a short documentary on Quistgaard and his work. Entitled &quot;A Saucepan for my Wife&quot;, the film follows the designer at his home and beyond, showing him at work and capturing his thoughts on what drives him as a designer.
If you're thinking you need something a little more Valentine's appropriate for the evening, how's this for romance: the film's title is a reference to the beginning of Quistgaard's work in design, when he just want to make a beautiful, functional saucepan for his wife. Now that's love. Watch a trailer for the 30 minute film here, and find out more about the designer at the Quistgaard website. For more information on the event, which takes place February 11th from 6 to 8 pm, click here.</body></row>

<body>In recent months we've noticed that Finest Pizza &amp; Deli on Avenue B at Fourth Street was no longer open 24 hours... A Curbed commenter wrote on this post yesterday:&quot;Because of La Souk being shut down, the bodega on Avenue B/4th street (next door) will not be renewing his lease. His profits are down $2000.00 a month since their closing. I liked it so much more when someone complained about the noise they were told to 'Shut Up'.&quot; That's just not true. There has been a minor movement to show what a loss Le Souk's closing has been on the neighborhood... those comments like, &quot;Le Souk made the LES upscale.&quot;At the CB3/SLA meeting in October, a Le Souk proponent stood up and said: &quot;the community was in shambles while Le Souk was closed.&quot; The argument focused on economics and the idea that this is not the time to shutter a club that brings much business to the neighborhood.In any event, the Finest Pizza &amp; Deli is NOT closing because Le Souk closed. Straight from an umimpeachable source:Abdul reports that there just isn't the business necessary for them to stay open late. They will stay open until around midnight or so on normal nights and possibly a bit later on weekends or if it gets crowded. He stated that it has nothing to do with Le Souk's closing, that the business had been dying for a while.</body></row>

<body>Not a month after the debuts of Sigmund pretzels and then SCRATCHbread, the Brooklyn Flea at One Hanson has announced that its latest purveyor is the Good Fork: “Ben and Sohui from the Fork will be rocking the pork-and-chive dumplings that are a staple on the Red Hook resto’s menu, as well as a Flea-friendly vegetable version, which we're excited to sample. They’re also debuting a chicken-and-sausage gumbo over rice — special for the Flea.” Eric Demby of the Flea tells us it’s likely to be just the first of other restaurants experimenting with the street-food thing once the Flea moves back outdoors on April 4.

The three-bedroom pad, which the couple purchased in 2003, first arrived on the market last October for $2.5 million.

<body>Donatella Arpaia of Mia Dona restaurant in New York provides six fun and easy tips on how to add a little romance into your Valentine's Day with desert! The Zagat-dubbed &quot;hostess with the mostess&quot; provides with six easy ways to add a little romance to your Valentine's Day with a little desert! Donatella was a former judge on &quot;The Next Iron Chef,&quot; and she has recently appeared on the TODAY Show. (View a past TODAY Show clip to see Donatella on TV!) Her tips are the perfect thing to add a little spice to your Valentine's Day meal. 1) You want interactive food that’s fun. For example, its time to finally break out your fondue pot or butter warmers to create a beautiful chocolate dipping sauce with long stemmed strawberries and a bowl of whipped cream on the side. Chocolate is an aphrodisiac after all! 2) Try a little Gourmet ice creams with special toppings – toasted coconut, sprinkles, etc. buy ice cream cones, sauces, etc. To add a little fun to your night, and show your Valentine that you care. 3) Nothing is better than chocolate. I like to buy the highest quality chocolate I can find and put them on glass slabs in an artful arrangement with flower petals. Serve it as desert or present it to your Valentine at the end of the night as another little special treat. You will win their heart in no time. 4) My favorite desert is molten chocolate cake, we actually serve a &quot;very sexy&quot; molten chocolate cake at Mia Dona - if you don't want to make one, just pick one up... we won't tell, and  pair it with something cold like ice cream or whipped cream, for an added appeal. With chocolate and ice-cream you can do no wrong! 5) Pastry rocks can be purchased from chefrubber.com – they are the gourmet poprocks and make you laugh and can be added to any dessert – perhaps to fruit with a little liquor.6) Always have a can of whipped cream nearby (yes, this is the only instance where a can is allowed)... add it where appropriate and have a Happy Valentine's Day!!DaVe Lipp</body></row>

<body>Since forming three years ago, La Strada, like most bands, has toured pretty incessantly, always returning back home to Brooklyn.As they follow up to last year's self-titled EP, the band (comprised of James Craft, Devon Press, Ted Lattis, Brady Miller, and Daniel Baer) took inspiration from a year of extensive tours and shows. &quot;New Home,&quot; out this spring and produced by Kyle “Slick” Johnson (Cymbals Eat Guitars, Modest Mouse, Fischerspooner), takes the EP’s clever, eclectic sounds and injects them with the intensity of a live performance.Take, for instance, the album's first track, “Go Forward,” which Craft wrote on a subway platform in Brooklyn. “I play the subway to test my material - just to play new tunes and see if they hit people,” says Craft. “I'm always double-checking that I'm a gut musician, not a concept musician.&quot;While the album's not dropped until April 20, you don't have to wait until the spring to hear the new tunes. The band recently did a session with Daytrotter featuring tracks from &quot;New Home,&quot; and they play the Bell House this Friday, opening for the Watson Twins in what's sure to be another raucous, foot-stomping show.Tickets are $10 in advance, $12 at the door. At 7:30 pm. The Bell House is located at 149 7th St.</body></row>

The show which was filmed at New York’s own Gotham Comedy Club runs about an hour and a half and shows what a confident performer Lange is despite his insecurities.  The best material in Artie’s set is his most personal and many of the funniest jokes will be familiar to fans of the radio show.  Unfortunately, Artie’s best bits are few and far between and the comic often veers from the heartfelt and lands in the more predictable territory of gay and hooker jokes for much of the show, pulling from a seemingly never-ending bag of hack.The best comedy often stems from personal trauma and rage and nothing says that more than 9 stab wounds to the abdomen so it’s a shame Lange doesn’t get real in his set.  He ends up appearing like any number of stage vets who go through the motions and he never feels in the moment.  When he does occasionally break from the mold it’s thoroughly interesting and funny and a few examples can be found on the DVD extras.  Lange has proven he has great ability in his time on the Stern show so hopefully he sticks around long enough to reach his potential onstage.Tim Needles</body></row>

<body>By John Capone		  	February 11, 2010 
	  				 	 			 				“It started last year in response to the economic downturn,” says Manom Slome, cofounder of No Longer Empty, a cooperative formed to stage site-specific exhibitions in vacant commercial spaces. “Walking on Madison one day, we counted about 15 empty storefronts,” Slome recalls. Confronted with all that unused square footage, the veteran curator, who spent seven years at the Guggenheim, and her colleague Asher Remy-Toledo saw an opportunity to put art in atypical places.

	 	  (’’)Since June, with space donated by various landlords, the group has put on shows in vacant storefronts beside the Chelsea Hotel, under the High Line and in a former belt factory in Brooklyn. (An artist from Italy transformed an abandoned freight elevator shaft into a version of Dante’s “Divine Comedy” that could take you up to heaven or down through the circles of hell). Through this Saturday, No Longer Empty, has taken up residence in the old Tower Records on Broadway and W. 4th Street, a venue that has been dark for going on three years. 

 

Dubbed “Never Can Say Goodbye,” the show re-imagines the old record store as, well, a record store, but rendered with a gallerist’s vivid imagination and a long time-East Villagers’ nostalgia. Upon entering the gallery, a Tower-yellow and -red kiosk recounts a little of the history of the spot. How it was a place where Mariah Carey, Tom Waits, The Talking Heads, Biggie Smalls, Metallica and Camper Van Beethoven all got equal time. 




“Diaspora&quot; by Paul Villinski, courtesy of Morgan Lehman Gallery.


One of the most prominently featured works in the gallery, Paul Villinski’s “Diaspora” (above) consists of birds made from vinyl records fluttering out from a turn table, and casting their shadows across a vast expanse of plain white wall. The elegiac tone of this piece is in keeping with the rest of the show. Along the walls, where record company promos once hung above racks of CDs, the artist Invader has created a series of reproductions of classic album covers, including “London Calling,” “Iron Maiden” and “Nevermind,” out of Rubik’s Cubes (below). Like a Seurat fed through an I Love The ‘80s, each image falls apart upon close inspection, but comes together as you back away.

A pimple-faced clerk greets you at the entrance to the No Longer Empty Never Records Shop (where, in fact, many items, including reproductions of some of the works on display, can be purchased), decked out in flannel, nerd-glasses and an expression that says he is silently judging you. Of course he’s made out of construction paper. (If you are hankering for the genuine scorn of living record store employees, Other Music is just around the block on w 4th.)


Some of the homages to yesteryear are a bit more tongue in cheek: A collection of Vanilla Ice teenie-bopper magazines are strewn on the floor, and run halfway up the ceiling. Upon seeing this display, The Roots’ ?uestlove, on site for a panel discussion about social media, told a story about running into the ur-white rapper on the street recently. “He greeted me like we were long lost brothers or something,” ?uest said incredulously. Then he mockingly flailed his arms across his chest, and intoned Ice-style, “‘Yo, ?uest. What’s up?’ Then I realized I was actually glad to see him. That’s how bad hip-hop is today.”







The show also contends with the effect of the digital age on music. For “The Song That Will Never Be Heard,” Paul Clement Williams wrote and recorded a song, made a compact disc of it and then destroyed the master and sealed the only copy CD in a glass box. It comes in a case emblazoned with a legalese-like warning stating that the owner of the work “solemnly vows never to deface the work by playing it or allowing others to hear it.” Another artist faithfully recreated her illegally downloaded MP3 collection by pasting downloaded album art on cardboard. Each of the handmade CD doppelgangers can be purchased for $9...</body></row>

<body>If you live in New York, or heck, anywhere in the tristate area, haul ass over to Park &amp; 59th Street PDQ. Dorie Greenspan, author of the much-loved cookbook Baking: From My Home to Yours, has opened a popup cookie shop inside the Mizu salon. It's called CookieBar, and her partner is her son, Josh. Just that fact fills me with all sorts of warm gooey feelings, trying to imagine me and Harry getting along well enough 25 years hence that we'd actually go into business together. After a wonderful, leisurely lunch date with Stephen at Il Buco (30% off thanks to BlackBoard Eats, another thing that all New Yorkers interested in food but too impoverished to eat out often must know about), I hightailed it up there today. The mini-shop opened yesterday and closes on Saturday, so I was prepared for a frenzy of cookie-obsessed fans. What I wasn't prepared for was the genteel, low-key feel of the enterprise, a simple table at the front of the salon, with a young woman handling sales and Dorie herself standing nearby, ready to chat with customers. I wanted to march right over to her and introduce myself (we've met in cyberworld, at the virtual dinner party for Monica Bhide's cookbook Modern Spice) but when I arrived around 1:30, there were only a handful of cookies left. The woman ahead of me was buying the last of the peanut butter and several of the molasses spice, too, and I feared the worst: What if she took them all? Clearly, there was no time to dillydally with Dorie. Must. Buy. Cookies. Now.While I waited, Dorie came close enough for me to introduce myself without losing my place. That woman is every bit as warm and inviting as her recipes. We chatted for a few minutes about the shop and her plans (they're looking for a permanent location, yippee!), and I confided that I'm working on a cookbook, too. We talked about the financial challenges of cookbook writing (chiefly: small advances -food costs -recipe testing = broke authors), and then it was my turn to order. There were only eight molasses spice cookies left. I took four; it felt wrong to leave the next person without any. And I'm so glad I did, because when Dorie saw how few cookies were left, she insisted on giving them away! I got two extra, and the two people behind me each got one as well. I love this woman. For reals. With generosity and kindness like this, her store is bound to be a ginormous hit. I can't wait.Oh, what's that? You want to know how the cookie tastes? Picture this: You've just come in from a bitterly cold and windy day. Your cheeks are burning; you can barely feel your fingers. The deep, mysterious-yet-familiar scent of spices greets you. Cinnamon, ginger, and something more... Immediately, you feel warmer. And when you bite into that cookie, chewy and deep and subtle, you know you're home.Seriously, folks, it was like the best hermit I've ever eaten, only without the raisins and other doodads that often gum up the works. Do not hesitate. Go to CookieBar tomorrow. And if you do, PLEASE report back here! I must live vicariously.CookieBar505 Park Avenue (inside Mizu)Open Mon 2/8-Sat 2/13</body></row>

<body>Man man man ist das kalt hier in Kuba! Heute früh schlüpfte ich unter zwei Decken  hervor und direkt in meine Jogginghose und den dicken Pulli. (Die Wollsocken und  die Mütze hatte ich schon an) Das Thermometer im Salon zeigte nur 17°C an und  stieg im laufe des Tages auch nur noch um 10°C an, was mir den ganzen Tag lang  eine Gänsehaut bescherte. Der Törn nach Cienfuegos bot viel Abwechslung. Es  begann mit viel Wind und eine Durchfahrt zwischen einer Riffkette, die richtig  passiert werden wollte. Wenig später setzte der kühle Wind, der aus den Bergen  kam, aus und Mr. Perkins kam zum Zug. Nach ein paar Studen bekamen wir dann aber  doch noch die Möglichkeit bei schönem Wind gemütlich zu segeln. Die Stadt liegt  an einer Binnenseegrossen Lagune, in die man 6 sm hinein fährt. Begrüßt wurden  wir an der Mauer der Guarda Frontera-Station mit den Worten ,,BIENVENIDA A CUBA  SOCIALISTA&quot;. Das Einklarieren ging völlig unkompliziert und die Zollmenschen  lachten uns sogar aus, als sie hörten, dass wir in Santiago de Cuba drei Stunden  lang durchsucht wurden. Neben Maria liegt wieder ihre nette neuseeländische  Freundin Sojourn, die wir in den letzten Wochen schon öfters getroffen haben.  Eben haben wir uns auf die Suche nach einem Restaurant gemacht (die Vorräte an  Bord sind nun bis auf die Spaghetti alle aufgebraucht). Auf dem Weg sprach uns  ein freundlicher Kubaner an, der uns zu seinem Freund brachte, der ein privates  Restaurant auf der Terasse seines Hauses betreibt. Das Essen war ausgesprochen  gut und der Service wirtschaftlich ausgedrückt Just in Time. Ein echter  Geheimtipp, für alle, die hier mal her kommen sollten. Die Stadt wirkt auf den  ersten Blick lebhafter, als das, was wir bisher von Kuba gesehen haben. Viele  Jugendliche liefen auf den Strassen herum und es gab mehrere Discotheken und  Bars. Morgen werden wir uns den Supermarkt vornehmen, an dem wir schon vorbei  gelaufen sind. Es sieht vielversprechend aus.... Gute Nacht (hoffentlich nicht so  kalt), Tania</body></row>

Also, the Yeti is hungry (photo by BTLR).It is storming again outside, shutting down most meetings (the Hoyt Street Association is still on tonight at 7 PM and the upcoming plant sale on May 1st and 2nd is on the agenda), which means its time to dig through the past few days of links for another morning round-up.*The New York Times has been shopping in Williamsburg recently, with a stop at Voos, the furniture store and 3rd Ward 2008 Solo Show artist Jeremy Leichman gets a shoutout.  *On the food front, The Brooklyn Paper visits the Van Leeuwen brothers who are opening a storefront on Manhattan Avenue in Greenpoint. Congrats, guys! Meanwhile, Gersh and Andy Campbell take a look at who has the best Tapas on Grand Street. The result? Everyone's a winner!*The Times also previews a new San Francisco-based coffee shop called Blue Bottle Coffee that is coming to the supersaturated Northside. Someone at the DOH needs to do air sample testing on Bedford Avenue for caffeine. I think we're over the recommended EPA guidelines.*The Brooklyn Kitchen wasn't the only institution to close this month (though the Meat Hook looks like a cross between Julie and Julia and Raiders of the Lost Ark). In Bay Ridge, The Hutch is liquidating its antiques, accessories, and kitchenware. The Courier's Helen Klein has more.*Question: What do Brooklyn's urban planners and transportation advocates do to blow off some steam? Answer: They dance their asses off at Cheryl.*Onto the hard news! Or at least, the kinds that isn't edible... The Courier's Tom Tracy looks at Borough President Marty Markowitz's discrimination suit while reporting Ken Lowy's fall from Independent Neighborhood Democrats. After all that, Tom hung out with some Trekkies in a standing room only crowd in Williamsburg. Big week for the Tracer.*The Greenpoint Gazette has a new issue out today with news about New Domino, the bill to federalize NYCHA buildings, and oil slicks on Newtown Creek, but the must-read article is Juliet Linderman's profile of Mario Fortunato of Fortunato Brothers and his return to the neighborhood from prison after his racketeering charges were overturned. None of this changes the fact that they make the best gelato and cheesecake in Brooklyn. In fact, I'm heading there tonight for a scoop of pistachio.*Finally, the Kosciuszko Bridge designs are out for review and they're down to four. Check out my report at The Courier here as well as CityRoom and the Brooklyn Paper's look at the Bridge to Somewhere. The Timesweekly, Queens TimesLedger , Queens Chronicle, and Queens Crap have the view from the other side of the river.

<body>From the NY Times:An analysis of campaign finance records shows that the top 10 individual donors to House and Senate members from New York include some of the nation’s leading figures in real estate, energy, finance and law. Together, they gave slightly more than $381,000 last year.Among organizations, the city’s white-shoe law firms and labor unions were the biggest givers, collectively contributing $1.5 million last year.Five major labor unions gave nearly $740,000 total to New York’s representatives in Congress, while a trial lawyers’ group, the American Association for Justice, gave $176,000 to New York’s delegation.The donors’ motivations vary widely, from a desire to protect their business interests to ideological allegiance to personal loyalty to concern over foreign policy. And they enjoy a level of access to the government that is unavailable to most people.George Tsunis, who, along with his wife is No. 2 on the list of individual donors with $49,200 in contributions, said that his favored beneficiaries included three New York lawmakers who share his concern over protecting the interests of the Greek Orthodox Church in Turkey: Representatives Nita M. Lowey, Gary L. Ackerman and Carolyn B. Maloney.“They’re all wonderful friends,” said Mr. Tsunis, the managing director of Chartwell Hotels, who estimates that he gave a total of $250,000 to candidates and party organizations across the country last year. “Congressman Ackerman came to my father’s wake.”Mr. Tsunis, who also oversees his family’s real estate holdings, acknowledges that the money he gives ensures that his phone calls are taken by politicians. “I think it would be very naïve if I told you it didn’t,” he said.</body></row>

<body>Friday February 19Location: Midtown West, NYCBands: Editors  Get Tickets HereShow time: 7 PMVenue: Terminal 5Food: Island Burgers and ShakesDrink: Smith’s Bar Miscellaneous: Colony MusicOn the Editors new album In This Light and On This Evening, the guys take their signature dance rock and pushes the envelope with a New Order feel. Check them live on their U.S. tour. For a kickass burger or chicken sandwich, Island Burgers and Shakes specializes in making great burgers like the Bourbon Street Burger that’s blackened, with bacon, Jack, bayou mayo, and onion on sourdough. One cheap bar in midtown, Smith’s Bar is a dive bar with cheap booze, friendly locals, and live music daily in the next room. Though the place is way expensive, Colony Music is a fun music store that sells albums and sheet music. You can walk around and check out the entertainment memorabilia. Whether you’re looking for an autographed guitar signed by the Rolling Stones or an autographed 8x10 of Linda Carter, they’ve got it.Friday February 19Location: West Village, NYCBands: FlyinFisch  Get Tickets HereShow time: 8 PMVenue: Sullivan HallFood: Tortilla FlatsDrink: White Horse Tavern Miscellaneous: Magnolia BakeryAdrian Fischer heads up FlyinFisch and blends reggae, afro-Caribbean, and pop rock that shows off some great worldy influences. Dinner before a show like this should be just as awesome. Check out Tortilla Flats. The food is Mexican and delicious, but it’s the insanity within (bingo and hula-hoop nights) that is the real calling for this place. For drinks afterwards, hit the White Horse Tavern, a great bar and the old haunting grounds for Dylan Thomas. If you somehow have time before all of this, stop by Magnolia Bakery for some of the best tasting cupcakes in the city.Saturday February 20Location: Park Slope, BrooklynEvent: Jersey Shore Dance PartyShow time: 12 AM; FREEVenue: Union  HallFood: Chiles &amp; Chocolate Oaxacan Kitchen Drink: The Gate Miscellaneous: Brooklyn Superhero Supply Co. Whether your a fan of MTV’s Jersey Shore or a true guido/guidette, celebrate the show that made the stereotype an accident you just couldn’t help but watch every week at the Jersey Shore Dance Party. Come dressed up as you favorite character or as a guido and a winner will be chosen for best costume. Ever have Oaxacan food? Chiles &amp; Chocolate Oaxacan Kitchen serves up some fantastic, not exactly Mexican food. Try the smoky flavored Mole Negro, one of the best mole sauces I’ve had in NYC. Before leaving, you must try one of the hot chocolates like the Chiles Y Chocolate. A hint of chipotle without too much heat is a nice kick start for the night. The Gate is a great Park Slope bar with excellent beers on tap and a outdoor courtyard to chill. If time permits, you must, and I mean MUST go to the Brooklyn Superhero Supply Co., a non-profit organization that helps kids with their writing, that’s fronted by a store selling super powers.Saturday February 20Location: Meatpacking District, NYCComedy: Tom GreenShow time: 8 PMVenue: ComixFood: Spice MarketDrink: PlungeMiscellaneous: Little Pie Company (located at 407 W14th St.) Canadian comic Tom Green returns, bringing his slapstick comedy (remember The Tom Green Show and when he was a rapper?) to the stage. For dinner, if you can get a table, check out Spice Market. Chef and owner Jean-Georges Vongerichten converted this HUGE space into one of the sexiest Asian restaurants in NYC. Serving up exquisite dishes like the onion and chili crusted short ribs with egg noodles and pea shoots ($22), Spice Market impresses. If you choose not to stay at APT for drinks, close by is Plunge. Located at the top of the Hotel Gansevoort, this rooftop lounge offers stunning views of the city. If dessert is your thing, stop over at Little Pie Company, where pies are baked on premises. Whether you’re in the mood for sour cream apple, southern pecan, or Mississippi mud pie, you can’t go wrong here.Sunday February 21Location: West Village, NYCEvent: Sunday Night Fixe Fetish Party  Get Tickets HereShow time: 10 PM-4 AMVenue: (le) poisson rougeFo...</body></row>

<body>All work and no play makes Jack a dull menswear designer. Swaim (Hutson), Michael (Bastian), and Robert (Geller), too. They were among the hordes who descended on the IAC building last night to toast the six nominees for the GQ Best New Menswear Designer in America Award, despite the looming shows. &quot;I'm going back to the studio after this,&quot; Hutson swore to us; his first full collection for Generra hits the runways this evening. Bespoke tailor turned ready-to-wear designer Craig Robinson would soon be reapplying his nose to the grindstone, too; he let it slip that he's working on suiting options for a certain Invictus Academy Award nominee. With his presentation on Sunday, nominee Billy Reid could afford to be a bit more relaxed. Rocking on his heels in front of his section of the installation, the Alabama-based designer said, &quot;It's an honor just to be nominated.&quot; Sure, but wouldn't it be nice to win? A Southern gent to the last, he just smiled. Hanuk Kim, meanwhile, told us that the pictures for his Fashion Loves Hanuk exhibition tonight weren't even on the walls yet. The truly important decisions, however, had been made. &quot;Bond St. is preparing the drinks,&quot; he said. &quot;That's what I really care about.&quot;—Matthew Schneier</body></row>

<body>As the snow began to accumulate this evening, many Chicago-area residents made special arrangements to get home on time.?
Tamara Hastings, 30, was in the middle of work about 3:30 p.m. When her boss told her the office was closing up early.
&quot;My work closed early so everyone could get home safely,&quot; said Hastings, an art director.Hastings, who lives with her husband in the West Loop, said her employers usually do not let the weather influence closing time.The snow hampered dinner plans for Hastings, who was supposed to drive to Oak Park tonight for a party.
Knowing the weather situation and traffic conditions on the Eisenhower Expressway?she did not want to deal with the hassle, Hastings said.
Tony Rosa, 48, of Crown Point, Ind., bypassed possible delays on the commuter train today and drove to his job in downtown Chicago instead.
Rosa, a manager at a law firm, said he does not let the snow ruin his commute.
&quot;We live in the Midwest so snow's nothing here,&quot; Rosa said.
Rosa's bosses let him out early today because of the weather.
When stuck in a traffic jam, &quot;I just listen to music -- it's my time,&quot; he said.? &quot;That and picture Florida a lot.&quot;
Mary Gasiunas, 59, shrugs her shoulders at the mention of snow.
&quot;It's nothing new -- I'm a Chicago girl,&quot; said Gasiunas, who was about 10 minutes late driving from Stickney to work in downtown today. &quot;This is my 60th winter here so I think I can handle it.&quot;
Derrick Thomas lives in Minnesota but was in the Edgewater neighborhood visiting his wheelchair-bound mother.
He planned to spend about 45 minutes shoveling near the end of the day.
&quot;We're just trying to stay on top of it,&quot; he said.
Snowfall caused the Gurnee Mills Mall in far north suburban Gurnee to close early this evening.?The plan is for the mall to reopen tomorrow at 10 a.m.

If you head to Chinatown tomorrow, be prepared for crowds celebrating the Lunar New Year (4708), the Year of the Tiger.  There will be a firecracker ceremony in Sara D. Roosevelt Park (Grand &amp; Chrystie) between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. The big parade, with lion, tiger, and unicorn dancers is next Sunday, 2/21, starting at 11:30 a.m.  

The Museum of Chinese in America has a walking tour next Saturday (2/20)  about Chinatown's New Year preparations and here are some other tips from the Daily News. If you're ordering Chinese food, here are some auspicious things to order.

On a much less festive note, this NY Times article about tigers being raised because of China's high demand for tiger parts is depressing.  The Wildlife Protection Society of India's executive director says, &quot;Unless the Chinese change their attitude, the tiger has no future on this earth.&quot;</body></row>

<body>If you're looking to get frisky this Valentine's Day, you're in the right city.TripAdvisor just named the Night Hotel in New York City the sexiest lodge in America, based on recommendations by TripAdvisor editors and travelers. Two other Big Apple spots make it into the travel site's list of top 10 sexiest hotels nationwide.These seductive city dwellings offer serious va-va-voom for Valentine?s vacationers seeking a sultry sanctuary ? deux (and since we know most New Yorkers can hear their neighbors having sex, you may want to try a room without paper-thin walls).Night Hotel, New York City, New York Average Nightly Rate: $251Description: As its name suggests, this modern and monochrome boutique hotel features very little light, making this the perfect spot for a romantic rendezvous with a significant other. TripAdvisor travelers say the guest rooms are cozy, and come complete with a copy of the Kama Sutra in the nightstand.Even the walls are covered with erotic art, with one TripAdvisor traveler noting, &quot;The lobby has photos of nearly nude women in masks that aren't for the prude!&quot;Hotel on Rivington, New York City, New York Average Nightly Rate: $393Description: This hotel offers stunning views of Manhattan, with each room boasting floor-to-ceiling glass walls ? but the vistas aren?t the only thing that will appeal to amorous guests.As one TripAdvisor traveler says, &quot;From the unconventional layout, to the glass curtain walling, to the voyeuristic shower walls, everything about this place screams hedonistic pleasure.&quot;The Library Hotel, New York City, New YorkAverage Nightly Rate: $338Description: This boutique hotel on Madison Avenue offers its guests a world first: more than 6,000 volumes of books organized throughout the property by the Dewey classification System. Skeptical that literature can set your pulse racing?Think again ? room 800.001 is packed with erotic tomes, including Casanova?s autobiography, while room 1100.006 is adorned with books on love and relationships.&quot;We had the erotic literature room and were surprised by the quality of books that we found,&quot; says one TripAdvisor traveler.TripAdvisor.com site data also reveals that Las Vegas, New York City and Miami boast the most sizzling hotels in the U.S., based on the &quot;sexy index,&quot; calculating the number of times that travelers use the term &quot;sexy&quot; in their candid TripAdvisor reviews.&quot;Whether couples are looking for a great value Valentine?s getaway or an once-in-a-lifetime luxury escape, TripAdvisor travelers recommend these hotels for a memorable romantic retreat,? said Christine Petersen, chief marketing officer for TripAdvisor.It's snow joke: The Vancouver Winter Games are here!

<body>We promise this will be our last Valentine's Day-related post for the year, in case you're  feeling the love. But we have to pass along this tidbit of information for anyone who just realized their significant other actually does want a gift, despite what he or she says. Take them down to the Curiosity Shoppe today or tomorrow and you can pick up a gorgeous bouquet by pro Megan Dempsey from Letter Paper Flower.
She'll be there from 12 to 3 both days arranging pretty–and affordable–blooms for your loved ones. Or go pick one up for yourself to brighten up the table, because you don't need no stinkin' Hallmark holiday to add a little lovely to your home. And while there, you'll also get a chance to browse the quirky and adorable selection of goods at the Shoppe. Sounds like a day worth celebrating to us.</body></row>

<body>1. UrbanDaddy's Pop-Up Wedding: We knew that the guys at UrbanDaddy liked typical guy stuff (sports, meat, booze), so we have to admit some surprise that they're turning Valentine's into an all-out celebration of matrimony. Couples can have an impulsive wedding, renew existing vows, or join the singles sipping on free champagne and fighting for the giveaway vibrators from Jimmyjane. Ah, love. RSVP here. (Sunday, February 14, 4-7 pm, at W Hotel, 181 3rd St., SOMA.)
2. Fillmore Fat Tuesday: Hot on the heels of their recent cocktail crawl, the Fillmore District restaurants are banding together once more to host a district-wide Fat Tuesday party. Special cocktails will be $6 at the various establishments, each of which will have its own live band and free sets of beads. Certain restaurants will also be offering Lousiana-style cuisine from gumbo to grits, to put the extra &quot;fat&quot; in the Tuesday. (Tuesday, February 16, 6 pm-12 am, at Fillmore District establishments: 1300 on Fillmore, Rasselas, Sheba Piano Lounge, Yoshi's, Fat Angel, Bruno's, and Gussie's Chicken and Waffles.)
3. Five After Five at Medjool: It's been a long time since we could shake off the little shudder we got every time we thought of Medjool, but the Mission's d-bag playground may have finally found a way to win us back. Every day from 5-7, they're offering $5 glasses of wine and $5 tapas in their lounge area. The early hour and non-roof location might just make up for the time we paid $12 for a watery gin-and-tonic and just managed to dodge a projectile-vomiting party girl. Keep it up, Medjool! (Daily, 5-7 pm, at Medjool, 2522 Mission St., Mission.)
4. Pisco's Carnival Wednesdays: The month of February is Carnival time in Brazil, and Pisco is celebrating by offering $5 caipirinhas every Wednesday for the rest of the month. If you're not familiar with the caipirinha, it's made with cachaca (a sugarcane liquor), muddled limes, and sugar, and is Portuguese for &quot;I had no idea I could get this wasted from a single drink.&quot; Pisco offers a traditional or raspberry version. If you want something to soften the blow, you can also get a new drink-and-tapa pairing for $12, which is available four nights a week and changes weekly. (Caipirinhas: Wednesdays in February, 5-8 pm; Tapa and Drink Special: Monday-Thursday, all night, at Pisco Latin Lounge, 1817 Market St., Upper Market.)
5. Bottomless Wine Dinners at Circa: To be filed under &quot;how on earth do they turn a profit,&quot; the Marina stalwart Circa is now offering a two-course meal with bottomless wine every Wednesday for $19. Yes, you read that right. Though we're not sure how long they can keep it up, it should be catnip for the locals, so often besotted with being sotted. (Wednesdays, 5:30-9 pm, at Circa, 2001 Chestnut St., Marina.)</body></row>

<body>I totally agree with lucymom about Slanted Door.  I always enjoy going there.  The setting is stunning.  I have no complaints about the food either.  Its just a fun place for a special meal.

And +1 to the cioppino suggestion above.  Good, fresh seafood can be maddeningly hard to get around here, but cioppino is the answer.  Or else think Asian.

And I'm not a La Cumbre guy.  Can't really comment on it since I just don't go there.  it certainly is an institution.  But if you want a place with table service, excellent nachos, a menu with lots more options, and a bar (margaritas), head across the street to Puerto Allegre.</body></row>

<body>The annual Rube Goldberg Machine Contest will be Friday, Feb. 26, at Discovery World at Pier Wisconsin, where more than a dozen high school teams will reveal their designs for hand sanitizer dispensers that do their deeds in at least 20 steps. The judging begins at 10:15 a.m. on Discovery World's preomenade, with finalists announced at 12:30 p.m. The final rounds are scheduled for 12:45 p.m., and the awards for 1:30 p.m.

The Rube Goldberg competition honors the Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist and engineer of the same name who became famous for his cartoons of overly complicated machines designed to do simple tasks. Last year's competition was well attended, and to get an idea of how intricate these machines can be, check out some video from last year or just hit YouTube for other examples.

This year?s participating schools are: Antigo High School, Arrowhead High School, Berlin High School, Burlington High School, Crivitz High School, Dubuque Senior High School, Janesville Craig High School, Kiel High School, Milwaukee Learning Laboratory &amp; Institute, Pius XI High School, Randolph High School, St. Catherine?s High School, Waunakee High School, Whitefish Bay High School and Wisconsin Conservatory of Lifelong Learning.</body></row>

<body>The Tribeca Trib 
By Matt Dunning


  Weeks after pieces of debris blown from the 77-story Beekman Tower, under construction at 8 Spruce Street, brought much of Lower Manhattan to a standstill, developer Forest City Ratner promised new steps to prevent a repeat of the dangerous incident.
  
  On Jan. 25, wind gusts approaching 100 miles an hour blew several small pieces of wood and metal from the upper floors of the Frank Gehry-designed, tower, forcing police to close several blocks near the tower for most of the day, including eastbound access to the nearby Brooklyn Bridge, crippling pedestrian and vehicular traffic Downtown.
  
  Earlier this week, Forest City Ratner Senior Vice President Joseph Rechichi said the company has installed new rigging for the orange safety nets surrounding the outer edges of the building’s unfinished floors, as well as reinforced tie-downs for the plywood hole covers throughout the tower. Rechichi said that while the rigging and plywood restraints the company had in place before the Jan. 25 storm met city standards, the company acknowledged that even more needed to be done.
  
  “We are absolutely committed to safety,” Rechichi said during a Feb. 9 meeting of Community Board 1’s Seaport/Civic Center Committee. “We’ve done new engineering calculations, and the reinforced systems will withstand winds of up to 125 mph. I’m professionally confident that the events of that day will not occur again.”

<body>A Santa Rosa man was in custody for allegedly kidnapping a woman, then beating and raping her for three days in his mobile home. 

Fifty-eight-year-old John Gomez was arrested Friday on suspicion of various kidnapping, sexual assault and drug charges. 

Sonoma County sheriff's deputies found the 40-year-old woman in the home with her ankle tethered to a bolt in the floor of Gomez's bedroom and suffering various injuries. They had gone to Western Mobile Home Park in south Santa Rosa after hearing from someone who had received a phone call for help from the victim. 

Deputies also found evidence of a drug sales operation in the mobile home. 
Gomez was arrested and booked into Sonoma County jail on suspicion of kidnapping to commit rape, rape by force, oral copulation by force, sodomy by force, sexual battery of a restrained victim, assault with a deadly weapon, torture and possession of a controlled substance. 

The woman was released from the tether and treated for various injuries. She told the deputies she had been tied up for three days, beaten with objects and sexually assaulted, according to the sheriff's office. 

Gomez was being held on $2.1 million bail. Authorities also detained his female roommate and released her pending criminal charges.</body></row>

<body>Good morning! I'm currently sitting in the Helen Mills Theater in New York City for the Independent Fashion Bloggers conference. I'll be live blogging the first panel, Fashion Blog Marketing Workshop. This live blogging session is sponsored by Windows 7. Follow the conference along with the livestream and utilizing the hashtag #ifbcon. Plus you can enter to win one of four Windows 7 laptops by sharing what you like about Windows 7 with the hashtag #IFBW7HP. Are you ready to learn about how to market yourself better as a fashion blogger?
10:36 am: The Fashion Blog Marketing Workshop has started! My girl Jordana Bruner of Clutch 22is moderating. I'm using the lightest computer in the world right now, a Sony Viao (model tbd).
10:43 am: You can watch the panels live, all day long here: http://heartifb.com/evolving-influence-live. What do you want to know about marketing a fashion blog?
10:46 am: The panelists are sharing their background and experiences. They seem super passionate about their chosen careers and seem to have a lot to offer the workshop.
10:49 am: The more I interact with G=Star (this is my 5th season to cover the show), I fall deeper and deeper in live. I love the brand's culture, aesthetic and consumer.
10:52 am: Finally delving into why bloggers are important to brands. Elle.com panelist speaks to how we can feed off one another. Personally, I have only seen one way communications from Elle.com, asking for links to their content, without really offering any relationships in return.
10:54 am: The panelist from G-Star loves the democratization of fashion, shifting the hierarchy of power from the top to the people. Power to the bloggers!
10:57 am: Threadbanger grew their business by forging relationships with bloggers. They called out great blog posts and trends and bloggers in turn featured them. I would really like to ask the Elle.com panelist if she believes the relationship is truly reciprical.
11:00 am: G-Star again for the win! Bloggers can be autonomous and a commiunity at the same time. Any brand is &quot;screwed without getting in or giving in to that dialogue.&quot; Elle.com attempted to use Twitter to research what to build next to serve their readers. They say they want to be part of the conversation, however I would disagree based on my interaction with their PR team.
11:03 am: ModCloth loves personal style bloggers who wear vintage and one-of-a-kind pieces. They love to see how we mix it up!
11:05 am: CRAVEcompany recommends bloggers turn to book publishing to build their brand. I am not sure I agree - sometimes it feels a bit like going backwards. Although, I won't be opposed to publishing a book with my On The Plus Side photos!
11:08 am: I finally agree with the panelist from Elle.com, though this isn't groundbreaking  news: do what you are good at.
11:15 am: Via Threadbanger &quot;Your blog is like sushi: keep it fresh!&quot; She also recommends tagging videos with relevant and topical keywords. Also, pay attention to your video thumbail - it's important!
11:18 am: Don't forget that you can describe your image using &quot;alt tags&quot;. G-Star advises us to be careful about branding - bloggers are &quot;kind of anti branding&quot;. What do you think?
11:21 am: I think when he says &quot;anti-branding&quot; I agree, but I also think that our brands are ourselves - being authentic is our brand.
11:24 am: I ask what G-Star looks for in terms of fashion and personal style bloggers with their forward-thinking approach to social media. In the context of blogs, there are too much of anything. They only notice the ones that are authentic and that aren't trying to be anything. Interesting.
11:30 am: The panel is winding down. A huge thank you to IFB and Windows 7 for making this live blogging session possible. I have really enjoyed my seamless, easy experience!

<body>By RG Writer: Agatha KhishchenkoWho doesn't love eating with their hands??? How fun would it be to share an utensil-free dinner with someone?? It's not as hard as you think.? We're not talking about fast food.?? Several great restaurants and chefs are putting a refined spin on finger foods in every genre of cooking. ? If you're craving Indian, Tabla's got tandoori-fired black pepper prawns ? There's southern hush puppies at Tipsy Parson, fried pork scratchings at Breslin, and shrimp corn dogs at Blue Smoke. ? We've scouted out some of the city's best gourmet finger foods...

?

Blue Smoke ????

Address: 116 East 27th
Street, btwn. Park &amp; Lexington Aves.

Phone: (212) 447-7733

Danny Meyer's barbeque joint takes classic finger foods to a new level.? Case in point:? Shrimp corn dogs with avocado- lime dip, deviled eggs with watercress, and warm, bbq
potato chips with blue cheese and bacon dip.?? Then, onto the rib sampler, a trio of Kansas City (saucy,) Memphis (lean) and Texas style ribs (dry-rubbed) with a side of hush puppies with jalapeno marmalade? This is innovative bbq with a dash of that trademark hospitality and polish Danny Meyer's so famous for. 

?



The Breslin

Address: 16 West 29th
Street, at Broadway 

Phone: (212) 679-1939

There's nobody better at British gastro pub affairs than Ken Friedman &amp; April Bloomfield.? First, there was the The Spotted Pig then The John Dory, and their newest venture, The Breslin, an offal-centric pub in the buzzing Ace Hotel. ?? You can lounge in the lobby and snack on Bloomfield's pork fat-boiled peanuts or fried pork scratchings.? There's meat-free alternatives, like malt vinegar &amp; sea salt
crisps, spiced almonds, and crazy good, caramel popcorn.? To drink, we love The
Garden Tonic, a cocktail of Hendrick’s Gin, cucumber, celery bitters and
tonic.? 

?



Double Crown 

Address: 316 Bowery, at
Bleecker Street 

Phone: (212) 254-0350

This
chic, East-meets-West restaurant has some of the most exotic
finger foods this side of the Bowery.? The duck buns are the best card they're holding, but there's also crispy whitebait with dried chili &amp; lime, a pint of
prawns (available in full or half pint), or pickled watermelon rind.? 

?

Tipsy Parson 

Address: 156 Ninth Avenue,
btwn. 19th &amp; 20th Sts. 

Phone: (212) 620-4545

The
ladies of Little Giant just opened a southern-inspired spot across town in Chelsea.? This beautiful Chelsea brownstone is reason enough to visit, but there are some wonderful finger foods.? Our favorite is the “The Fry Up” -? a mix of cornmeal- battered winter
vegetables served alongside a pepper vinegar &amp; lemon aioli.? There are lots of other options, like the
cheese straws, hush puppies, and fried pickles.? 

?

Tabla 

Address: 11 Madison Ave.,
at 25th St.

Phone: (212) 889-0667

You can always count on Tabla for some of New York’s
most creative, New Indian cuisine.? But who knew Floyd Cardoza made great finger food too??? Our favorite is the fish brandade samosa with purple potatoes, radish, and maple vinaigrette. ? But there's also shell-on, tandoori-fired black pepper prawns coated in a spice blend of coriander seeds &amp; black pepper or Cardoza's take on  saag paneer: Shaped like a slice of pizza? with a corn roti base and layered with
spiced creamed spinach and Coach Farm goat cheese.?? Finish with Tabla's homemade doughnut holes with
orange blossom essence and a trio of sauces.? 



?

T Poutine 

Address: 168 Ludlow Street.
btwn. Houston &amp; Stanton Sts. 

Phone: (646) 833-7444

As the name suggests, this LES restaurant specializes in poutine, the national
dish of Canada.?? This is extreme comfort food – French fries, smothered in gravy and fresh
cheese curds.?? There are eight versions, including a Tex-Mex riff and the Montreal Meatlover topped with smoked meat.? Even better, you can create your own poutine, choosing from a variety of toppings. ? For dessert, there's homemade beignets or sweet
potato fries with spiced cinnamon sugar and warm maple syrup.? No utensils necessary. 

?

<body>You might be tempted to picnic near Mavericks Point, but there's some good food along Route 1. 		Mavericks is on for the first time since 2008, and 40-foot swells and a sunny day are predicted for tomorrow down in Princeton-by-the-Sea, just north of Half Moon Bay. If you're going to attempt to join in the fun and watch the big-wave surfers perform death-defying acts of bodacious grandeur, might we recommend stopping off in Pescadero before or after, at the historic Duarte's Tavern. 		They've been around since the dawn of time (1894), and they serve a mean cioppino, and an even meaner cream of artichoke soup.  Also, they are known for their pies, which are also pretty fantastic and can now be purchased frozen at various tony grocers around the Bay.

If you're looking for something a little ritzier with views of the ocean, you may want to check out the recently opened La Costanera in the former Chart House space in Montara. Michael Bauer was only mildly impressed with the food, but he couldn't say enough about the drama of the setting.

And for the ritziest experience, you could drop in at Navio at the Ritz-Carlton Half Moon Bay, which is sold out for dinner but still has seats available for lunch, which is served until 2 p.m. They've also got a wine, cheese and chocolate bar if you just want to drop in for a glass.

If you want a closer view of the competition and don't feel like driving, you may want to check out viewing parties at The Riptide out by ocean; Cityhouse at the Parc 55 hotel, where they'll be showing Mavericks as well as the Winter Olympics on their 42-inch screens; Miss Pearl's Jam House in Oakland, but you better arrive early; and the great big jumbo-tron at AT&amp;T Park (tickets are $20 in advance, $25 at the door).

<body>When I went to California Pizza Kitchen the other day, I wasn't in the mood for a pizza.  Luckily for me this was not a problem because I saw this yummy new salad they had on their menu: their Moroccan Chicken Salad.  Here is how they describe it  I got the large version for about $12, but I probably would have been fine with a half salad the portion was so huge:Moroccan-spiced chicken breast with crisp Romaine lettuce, roasted butternut squash, Medjool dates, fresh avocado, toasted almonds, fresh beets, chopped egg, carrots, dried cranberries and red bell peppers. Tossed with our champagne vinaigrette.I really just wanted to get it for the dates, but overall I was completey happy with the whole package.  There were LOTS of these ingredients, especially the dates which made the plate nice and colorful.  All the ingredients were featured, though they were heavy on the dried cranberries rather than the dates (understandably).  I would absolutely order this again, in fact, it would be hard to order a pizza over this salad.  I hope they keep it around! I also tried the white sangria (Caribbean Sunset Sangria to be exact) for $7.50, it was quite delicious and sweet with a lot of peach puree.  I thought this was lovely, but could only have one because of the sweetness.In the end, I was super happy with my meal!

<body>Miguel and Bobby 		Bobby Flay threw down with Victor and Miguel Escobedo at Papalote on last night's episode of Throwdown with Bobby Flay, and SF's star burrito boys came out victorious. Flay called their Mexi-pino burritos &quot;the best in the country,&quot; but to compete Bobby threw together a lameass &quot;all-green burrito&quot; with chile verde, green rice, guacamole, white beans, and a green apple vinaigrette. Needless to say, the Escobedos' Triple Threat burrito (shrimp, chicken, carne asada) wowed the assembled crowd more, and Flay, sounding like he knew he was throwing this fight, said he should have known not &quot;to do some newfangled burrito when you're in the Mission District of San Francisco.&quot; True dat. 		In related news, SFoodie reports that Papalote is now offering their adobo chicken burrito (now named the Poleng Burrito, in honor of their recently shuttered neighbor, the Filipino-inspired Poleng Lounge) every day instead of just as a special, following some recent coverage it received on the Filipino channel Balitang America. Watch said coverage below.

<body>Finally, the secret of how the Mets convince free agents to sign with them has been revealed.The team's Spring Training facility has a parking lot for players and coaches with the 15 spots closest to the entrance reserved. Jerry Manuel and team equipment manager Charlie Samuels get two of the spots with the other 13 given to players based on a formula that seems to be based on seniority, importance to team and that ineffable, intangible something that belongs only to the Mets' decision making process.Johan Santana, David Wright and other stars are obviously granted parking privileges, although one wonders how often Carlos Beltran will be using his this season. Newly signed players Henry Blanco and Kelvim Escobar are among the chosen baker's dozen, while Daniel Murphy will have to deal with a few extra steps of fatigue before he works on his first base defense drills. Alex Cora, the backup infielder with the multimillion dollar contract, has a spot, although Ted Berg of SNY is surprised to hear it because he figured Omar Minaya gave him a heliport upon signing. Jeff Francoeur has a spot, which makes a lot of sense because there's no player in the major leagues who likes taking a walk less than the Mets right fielder.While it's good for a laugh or two, the difference of 35 or 50 feet of asphalt between parking places is ultimately meaningless, with one possible exception. Mike Pelfrey and Oliver Perez both have reserved spots, while John Maine is relegated to the outer reaches with the rest of the riff-raff. That might provide a peek into how the Mets think their presumed four top starters stack up entering the season, which is a bit odd given that Maine pitched better than Perez last season.Maine also wasn't overweight and in need of a little extra exercise, but there's a pretty good chance that Perez had the spot written into the $36 million contract gifted on him before the 2009 season.Those parking spots will start mattering in about 24 hours when pitchers and catchers report to camp on Thursday.

<body>Ridgewood jumpers, vaulters set recordsFriday, February 5, 2010BY TIM LEONARDThe RecordSTAFF WRITERhttp://www.northjersey.com/sports/83616987_Ridgewood_duo_set_records.html#TOMS RIVER — It was easy to find a Ridgewood athlete at the North 1, Group 4 indoor track championships. All you had to do was look up.There were Maroons flying higher than anyone at the Bennett Center on Thursday. Ridgewood boys and girls took first place in both the pole vault and the high jump, setting or tying meet records in the process.Those results helped lead the Maroons to a second-place finish in the girls’ competition and a third-place finish for the boys. The Ridgewood boys scored 47 points. West Orange was the boys champion with 80 points. The Ridgewood girls finished with 41 1/2 points, well behind Randolph, which won the title with 105 points. Passaic Tech (34) and Clifton (26 1/2) came in third and fourth, respectively.The top six finishers in each event advanced to the State group finals on Feb. 14 at the Bennett Center.&quot;All of us are super-dedicated. We practice every day like it’s a meet,&quot; Ridgewood junior pole vaulter Kayla Polcari said. &quot;There’s a lot of internal support.&quot;Polcari was able to clear 11 feet 6 inches on her first attempt, breaking the group record that was shared by her sister, Ann. She scraped the bar as she went over it, but it bobbed up and down a few times before steadying as Polcari watched hopefully from the landing pad. Emily Urciuoli of Clifton, who also had a share of the record, finished second at 11-0, more than a foot below her Passaic County record.John Wisener won the boys pole vault in a jump-off, clearing 13 feet in fewer attempts to decide the event. That broke a record that was shared by George Mena of Clifton, who cleared 12-6 in 2008.Both high jump medals were going to the same house. Tommy DeVita won the boys event by clearing 6-6, tying the record set by Marcos McKenzie of Eastside in 2008. Sarah DeVita took the girls event with a jump of 5-0, tying a record equaled by Brittney Kilkeny of North Bergen in 2009. Their younger sister, Mimi, took sixth in the pole vault.&quot;We always come in knowing we’re one of the best teams and trying to compete at that level,&quot; Tommy DeVita said. &quot;It’s nice that we can have two people be among the elite in their events.&quot;Kennedy also swept an event, winning both of the 55 hurdles races. Keshon Brown edged Josh Major of West Orange to win the boys 55 hurdles in 7.56. Jaivairia Bacote won the girls race in 8.56.Amber Allen of Passaic Tech had one of the top individual performances of the day. Allen won the 55-meter dash and the 400, coming back later to contribute to PCT’s first-place finish in the 1,600 relay. Allen doesn’t normally compete in the 55, but won the event in 7.53 seconds, edging Julisa Isom of Kennedy, who ran 7.54. Allen will run the 400 and the relay at the State Group 4 meet.http://www.northjersey.com/sports/83616987_Ridgewood_duo_set_records.html#</body></row>

<body>Curated by Mollie O’Brien, as part of our guest curated PERFORMANCE &amp; DISCUSSION SERIES, this showcase features work by choreographers who are also parents.

The PERFORMANCE &amp; DISCUSSSION SERIES includes post-performance moderated discussions to give audiences and artists a forum to talk about issues that come up within the work. For this showcase, the discussion will revolve around going back to work after children. As a point of departure, the conversation will begin with &quot;How do choreographers continue to work once they have children?&quot;, &quot;How does being a parent influence the creative process?&quot; and &quot;How do artists balance their artistic and family lives?&quot;

Featuring: Ori Flomin, Katherine Longstreth and Kristi Spessard

<body>ATLANTA — Georgians expecting a brisk bounce back in the economy and rapid job creation due to pent-up demand are thinking of the wrong type of recovery, according to a prominent economist.
“Previous sharp recoveries were accompanied by a strong recovery in jobs — one that is notably absent at present as investment spending, a leading indicator of job growth, continues to be weak,” said Rajeev Dhawan, director of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University.
The center released its quarterly forecast Wednesday morning.</body></row>

<body>ATLANTA (AP) - A north Georgia senator is proposing legislation
to create a state-wide alert system to speed the apprehension of
criminals who kill or seriously injure local, state, or federal law
enforcement officers.
?  ?  Sen. Jeff Mullis of Chickamauga is introducing Senate Bill 397
behalf of the Georgia Fraternal Order of Police.
?  ?  Similar to the Amber Alert law, the proposed Blue Alert would
activate Georgia Department of Transportation message boards and
other state messaging systems to notify the public when a police
officer has been killed or seriously injured and the perpetrator is
at large.
?  ?  A Chattahoochee Hills police officer was shot to death in his
car earlier this week, and a $35,000 reward is being offered in the
case. No arrests have been made. The shooting would have activated
a Blue Alert if the law had been on the books.</body></row>

The current owners would like to split their current lot for tax reasons. There is one tax on the parcel and they feel it is difficult to equitably split this. if there are two parcels, then they would be taxed on their individual appraisal. The Commission motioned and approved to table this until the owners have a chance to better explore their options. It was suggested there may be a better way of resolving their financial issues. The Commission also requested legal documentation establishing proper easement rights to the rear portion of the parcelMANDATORY REFERRALS1.

Anything other than small coops will still need to be approved. Motion to approve - passed2.?Ordinance No. 1268-09 (former Ward 3/New Ward 6/Mitchell):? An emergency ordinance authorizing the sale of real property as part of the Land Reutilization Program and located ?11300 Kinsman Road?to Greater Friendship Baptist Church.This was originally submitted by the former councilperson under the impression the lot would be improved with parking for the multi-family structure adjacent to ?the property. The application was originally submitted proposing open space and the applicant told the planning staff subsequent to the legislation introduction that it is NOT his intention to develop a parking lot. The current councilperson does not support the legislation to sell if it is not for a parking lot.Motion to not approved - passed.3.?Ordinance No. 13-10 (Ward 15/Zone):??Authorizing the Director of Parks, Recreation and Properties to enter into a property adoption agreement with the Detroit Shoreway Community Development Organization to maintain the Gordon Square parking lots known as Kennedy Lot and CPT Lot.This will enable the Detroit Shoreway Community Development Corporation?the responsibility of maintaining parking lots servicing the Gordon Square segment of Detroit Avenue.

<body>Tom was someone who I saw two, three sometimes four times a day. He was a genuine man, who was always willing to chat. When my wife was pregnant with our son, Tom would carry things for us and he always remembered the exact birthday of our son. He would see us months later and tell us that our son was 21 weeks now and he was always correct down to the day. Tom told me he was born in 1945, so I guess he must have been 64 when he died. He was a great part of this neighborhood and will be missed. The neighborhood is Brooklyn and Tom was the neighborhood, &quot;Tom Was/Is Brooklyn&quot;. He was always &quot;Doing All Right For a Monday Night&quot; and when he disappeared a few month back, we had a feeling that something was off. The neighborhood changed, but his presence is still felt.  Every night you would find Tom: --------------Article from NYTimes   Panhandlers in this city are often ignored, stiffed, even reviled, but sometimes, if they hang around long enough and take the right approach, they can work themselves not only into the wallets, but also into the hearts of those they solicit.  Such was the case with Tom, the Concierge of Court Street.  Tom was the guy who held the door as you walked in and out of the Super Deli, outside of which he was a daily fixture, on Court Street between Baltic and Kane Streets in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn. He was the guy who offered to carry your shopping bags, or simply offered a bit of conversation. Tips were welcomed but not required.  “Tom was genuinely friendly, even to people who never gave him money,” recalled Ursula Alexander, who lives nearby. “He was good-natured, one of those people in the city who have a big impact, even though we never get to know them.”  So when word spread on Court Street that Tom died last month, he was honored with a sidewalk memorial of posters, flowers and photographs. It was stomach cancer, somebody heard. How old was he? Somewhere around 50, it seemed. Supposedly he lived with his mother in nearby public housing projects: Wyckoff Gardens, was it? Or maybe Gowanus Houses. And what was his last name, again?  He was cheery, talkative, helpful and benign, many said, a secondary character in the daily narrative of this busy street. He would arrive in the afternoon, in time to catch riders streaming up out of the Warren Street exit of the Bergen Street subway station, returning from work in Manhattan.   Court Street memorial.  Tom was no wino, and he was not homeless. He appreciated gifts of food, and would load them into his backpack to bring home at night. When Tom stopped showing up, several months back, his many friends and benefactors on Court Street did not know where to look, or even have a last name to go with.  “I spoke to him every day but I never knew his last name,” said Robin Gurung, who works afternoons and evenings in the grocery store. “No one did. Everyone just knew him as Tom.”  Here is a photo of Robin @joncronin:     Tom would often take dollar bills and walk across the street to Ruben Liquors, to try for bigger winnings. He would buy scratch-off lottery cards, said the owners, Brenda and Rick Ruben.  “If Tom was a drinker, we’d know it,” said Rick Ruben. “He was just a happy-go-lucky guy.”  Ms. Alexander, paying for a bottle of Jack Daniels, looked over.  “Are you talking about Tom?” she asked. “At first I ignored him when he offered to carry my shopping bags, I didn’t know anything about him. But I saw he was good-natured and that’s worth a lot.”  Next to the deli on Court Street is Sam’s Restaurant, now in its 80th year under the same family ownership.  Louis Migliaccio, who took the place over recently from his father, Mario Migliaccio, 82, was doing his billing at one of the tables.  “Why is everyone making such a big deal about this guy?” he said, gesturing out the window toward the sidewalk memorial. “Fifty thousand people walk in here asking about Tom, no one buys nothing.”  The specialty at Sam’s is pizza made in a brick oven. The elder Mr. Migliaccio has been making them himself for nearly 60 years.  On the wall was a sign:    Today’s Menu, Two ...</body></row>

<body>The 2010 Political Season has no shortage of news, and that's true in Oakland, CA.  Tonight, Oakland Mayor Ron Dellums gives his State of The City address.  And the behind-the-scenes-buzz is the rumor (not as of this writing denied) that Oakland Councilmember Nadel's not meeting with Oakland District Four City Council candidate Libby Schaaf. 

First, some important news.  The City of Oakland has redesigned its website!  The Beta-stage Oaklandnet.com is up and operational.  That deserves a cheer and not of the Bronx kind.  The City of Oakland website had become a visual and navigational mess.  The new design, while it still needs a ton of help in the social network area, is a massive improvement over the old 20th Century model, and an example of what Oakland can do when it gets its act together.  Bravo!   

Second, Mayor Ron Dellums.  The good Oakland Mayor Ron Dellums is set to give his 2010 State of The City Speech tonight at 5:30 PM at Oakland City Hall.  The good news is that Mayor Dellums isn't giving the speech behind the cloud of controversy that was the Oscar Grant Murder. The Oscar Grant tragedy threatened to rip Oakland with seemingly constant days of rioting.  It even impacted the Mayor's 2009 State of The City Address:

  

But this year, the Mayor will report to a drop in the overall crime rate in Oakland, and new restaurants and businesses to be proud of.  Dellums should also note Oakland City Attorney John Russo's injunction sought to restrict gang activity.  I seriously doubt Mayor Dellums will explain that he's going to stop choking Oakland's poorest citizens with the draconian parking enforcement process, but we'll see.  One person who will be listening in attendance is Green Party Candidate for Oakland Mayor, Don MacLeay.

Don MacLeay says he will &quot;go with an open mind&quot; because Mayor Dellums has &quot;been out there raising money for the City&quot;.  MacLeay, who reports his campaign's gathering steam, says that his opponent, Oakland District Four Councilmember Jean Quan &quot;has associated herself with everything from Haiti to the Lunar New Year, but when it comes to (The City of Oakland's) budget cuts, she refers to herself in the third person.&quot;  

One Oakland politico who doesn't do that is Oakland District Three Councilmember Nancy Nadel, whom this blogger endorsed for reelection in 2008, apparently has made her decision regarding who to support in the District Four City Council Election this year.  I'm told by three different people Nadel has refused to meet with Libby Schaaf, who I openly support for the council seat.  (I do so hope there's a connection, there!)

In fairness to Nadel, who I think has represented West Oakland well (remember, the difference is that Nancy, for all of her complex ups and downs, cares about an area of Oakland that at times seems forgotten) I contacted her about this news.  She was to follow up with me from her personal email, so I'm waiting for that (sort of).  Nadel's not been in a rush to deny the claim.  



Nancy Nadel?


If this is the case, and hopefully it's not, it's a very bad move for Nadel.  Libby's a front runner in a crowded field of people; should she win, Councilmember Nadel will have to work with her.  Let's hope all of this isn't true.   (As a note, even though Libby's supported in this space it doesn't mean other political candidates will not be contacted or featured in a blog post.) 

Oakland Mayoral Candidate Don Perata continues to be hit over the political head by people who've donated to his campaign then gotten into some kind of FBI trouble.  Again, the East Bay Express comes to the rescue of the maintenance of the already healthy &quot;Don Perata FBI&quot; search results. (Even though they cite the Contra Costa County Times, the East Bay Express beats them in Google search results)

This time, reportedly it's the &quot;Seeno family&quot;, under investigation by the FBI, IRS, and the Secret Service.   What real connection Don Perata has to this family of developers and investors is they've known each other since 2000 and Perata's campaign got &quot;at leas...</body></row>

<body>Location: East Village, NYCEvent: Revealed BurlesqueShow time: 10 PMVenue: UNDER St. MarksFood: OyamaDrink: Grassroots TavernMiscellaneous: Mud CafeRevealed Burlesque is MC’d by Bastard Keith and stars pin-up queen and Miss Coney Island 2010 GiGi La Femme alongside several of the best burlesque performers in New York and around the world including Clams Casino, Harvest Moon, Kobyashi Maru, Ms. Tickle, and in her Revealed debut, Miss Marlo Marquise. With sushi that’s 50 percent off all the time, you might think, “Something’s wrong with that?” but the fish is good and the rolls are inventive, making Oyama one of the best low-priced sushi joints in the city. Though St. Marks all of a sudden lost its charm, Grassroots Tavern hasn’t. This large dive bar has cheap drinks, darts in the back, and old men behind the bar, things a good dive bar should have. Excellent coffee served in a big mug and a healthy menu of food coupled with a year round enclosed outdoor backyard patio make Mud Cafe a great little coffee shop in the area.</body></row>

<body>This spring, Bryant Park will host a free eight-week outdoor art exhibit, “Earth From Above,” featuring large-scale aerial photography by Yann Arthus-Bertrand, a United Nations Environmental Program Goodwill Ambassador.
All 120 of the 4-foot by 6-foot photographs will be “accompanied by captions that link the image to the environmental and social issues at stake, inviting the onlooker to consider sustainable development as the solution to the challenges brought into focus,” organizers said today in a news release announcing the dates for the show.
The exhibition, from April 2 through May 28, is timed to coincide with the 40th anniversary of Earth Day, orgnizers said today. “Earth From Above” was first exhibited in Paris in 2000 and has traveled to more than 120 cities.

<body>Pahua heiau, at the end of Makahuena Place, offers some evidence that this area may once have been a center of fishing and agriculture in what is now Hawaii Kai.   The structure, estimated to be about 600 years old, is thought to have been an agricultural heiau or fishing shrine used by ancient Hawaiians planting sweet potatoes and dryland kalo (taro) or harvesting from fishponds that once lined the coast.Pahua heiau sits on land gifted to OHA (Office of Hawaiian Affairs) by Kamehameha Schools in 1988. The heiau was partially restored by the Outdoor Circle in the mid-1980s, but remains relatively obscure to any but Hawaiian cultural practitioners and hikers, who reference the heiau as the starting landmark of the Kamiloiki Ridge Trail.OHA conservation land manager Kevin Chang believes that the site can be a vehicle for community dialogue about sustainable land use and stewardship over a culturally significant resource.  Chang applied for, and received, a $10,000 national conservation grant from Audubon and Toyota. This TogetherGreen Fellowship is meant to engage local residents in conservation and environmental health practices at the community level.&quot;Among OHA's goals for real estate is this idea of bridging the ancient use of land with future land use patterns,&quot; said Jonathan Scheuer, land management director for OHA. &quot;As Hawai'i continues to change and develop, we want to do so in a way that the historic presence of Hawaiians is not obliterated from the landscape.&quot;Chang is using the resources of OHA to assess the full historical relevance of Pahua heiau and the best way to revive the site's cultural significance within the surrounding community.  &quot;I'm going about it slowly. We want to be good neighbors and also culturally appropriate,&quot; said Chang. &quot;It's balancing the past and the present and also breathing life into something we tend to see as only existing in the past.&quot;Hawaii Kai is truly a special place.

<body>Several hundred people showed up at the Hawaii State Capitol for the annual &quot;March For Life&quot; - a political rally that demonstrates Hawaii and the nation's commitment to saving lives of the &quot;pre-born&quot;. The march usually falls on the anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling on Roe vs. Wade that allowed for the legalization of abortion.Today the pro-life marches and rally have extended to issues such as the opposition to assisted suicide and the upholding of traditional family values. Many of the people participating in this year's march are also opposed to same sex marriage.More information on the March For Life can be found at the following links:March For LifeHawaii Family Forum</body></row>

<body>Kevin Lembo is Connecticut's Healthcare Advocate, an independent state official who advocates for patients and their families on health insurance and other aspects of the health care system.&amp;#xD;He has written a Commentary piece which is published in the Hartford Courant. I am pasting in a taste of it.&amp;#xD;&amp;#xD;Dean Rohrer illustration&amp;#xD;&amp;#xD;The At-Home Alternative To Nursing Home&amp;#xD;Connecticut's approach to long-term care suffers from an extreme case of &quot;business as usual&quot; - a chronic condition that manifests itself in poor and limited service delivery, and continually stressed budgets. The good news is that it's treatable.&amp;#xD;Please read his full Editorial in the Hartford Courant  &amp;#xD;[...] what if there were a way to rein in costs and, at the same time, help us to satisfy the desire of our elders (and ourselves) to stay at home - to age in place - and prevent or delay going into a nursing home? The answer just might be a &quot;Nursing Home Without Walls.&quot;&amp;#xD;I was first introduced to the Nursing Home Without Walls concept in New York state in the mid-1980s. A rambunctious but powerful Republican state senator in New York, Tarky Lombardi, successfully got a program started in 1977, and it has grown ever since. The concept is simple: If you can safely and more economically provide care at home for someone who would otherwise be admitted to a nursing home, the long-term home care provider can bill 75 percent of the cost of nursing home care to maintain the individual in the community, and prevent or delay nursing home admission.&amp;#xD;All of the services that are offered in the nursing home would be offered at home and, in addition, resources could be spent to modify the home environment to accommodate changing needs - ramps and grab bars, for example.&amp;#xD;&amp;#xD;At this point he goes into the cost details, and then says:&amp;#xD;Instead of business as usual, why don't we try an innovative approach that has been successful elsewhere? An approach that offers us the choice to stay in our own home, surrounded by the people and things that bring us comfort? It will take courage and determination to make such a change, but can we afford not to?&amp;#xD;Kevin Lembo is a candidate for Lieutenant Governor. I think right now he is the only candidate for this position. He brings a fresh approach to the job, starting with the fact that he considers it a Real job.&amp;#xD;&amp;#xD;This photo (with MLN's Ctblogger) accompanies an article written by Paul Bass at  the New Haven Independent.</body></row>

<body>So we got our first taste of DJ life this past Tuesday at Let Go! At The Lockerbie.  Soooo fun!  Just to be clear, I know I am a novice in the most absolute sense of the word...no way do I fancy myself even on the path to be a REAL DJ.  The experience gave me such a new respect for those that are/have made DJing a way of life/do it on a nightly/weekly/monthly basis.  As a show promoter, it was such a completely different feeling being part of the show versus producing the show...a totally different kind of rush.  Anyway, huge thanks to A Squared Industries for offering me the lessons and allowing me to have some fun.The experience helped me realize how little time and exposure we actually give to all the local DJ talent here in Indianapolis and surrounding areas.  Today on MOKB, we start what I hope to be a reoccurring series entitled THE BOUNCE.I'll be contacting my favorite local, regional and occasionally national/international DJs, of all genres, and asking them what song they play, or have produced, really gets the party going.The timing seems appropriate as MOKB and Muzique Boutique welcome The Hood Internet back to Indianapolis this Thursday, February 11th, at BLU Nightclub.  See the poster here.MP3 : ABX - Ignition (Keep It Remixing Louder) (R. Kelly vs Major Lazer) (THX!)Two of the DJs also performing that evening are Slater Hogan and Phenom.  They've both been so kind as so send in a banger today...(photo cred : Rachel Rubenstein)Slater writes, &quot;We took an old traditional Balkan track and filpped it into a warehouse banger.&quot;MP3 : Slater Hogan and John Larner - The GypsyYou can find Slater, every Thursday night, at Keepin' It Deep @ Blu LoungeEach week, Keepin It Deep hosts 3-5 guest DJ's throwing down various styles of electronic music.

<body>FOX 59 News' Russ McQuaid has an exclusive story on a new probe the FBI has launched into influence peddling in the Marion County Prosecutor's Office. Prosecutor Carl Brizzi, who is already under suspicion for his ties to alleged Ponzi scheme operator Timothy Durham, is the focus of the probe along with his chief deputy, David Wyser, who is running for Hamilton Co. Prosecutor. Allegations center around a case where a millionaire Indianapolis businessman contributed tens of thousands of dollars to the campaigns of Brizzi and Wyser before the two prosecutors agreed to a modified sentence for a convicted murderer who had served only 18 years of a 110-year sentence for being found guilty of hiring a hit man to kill her husband. The convicted murderer's father made the large contributions to Brizzi and Wyser. Those tainted contributions were returned to the murderer's father within the last few days as this probe heated up. Hats off to former Marion Co. Judge Gary Miller, a Republican, for having the courage and conviction to speak out against Brizzi's and Wyser's conduct in this matter. Russ McQuaid reports:The FBI inquiries come in the wake of a high profile raid by federal agents in November at the offices of financier Tim Durham on Monument Circle. Durham is a close friend and campaign supporter of Brizzi, donating nearly $200,000 to the prosecutor's re-election campaign in 2006.An attorney for Brizzi, Tom Collignon, told Fox 59 News that it would be, &quot;a leap of faith,&quot; to construe an FBI inquiry as an investigation.Word of the FBI inquiry comes as Fox 59 News has uncovered a pattern of campaign donations to both Brizzi and his Chief Trial Deputy David Wyser at the time when the prosecutor's office was signing off on a motion to reduce the prison time of a woman originally sentenced to 110 years for the murder of her husband.Paula Epperly Willoughby was convicted in the killing of her husband Darrell in 1991. After just 18 years in prison, Epperly Willoughby's sentenced was modified to time served.&quot;I was outraged,&quot; said former judge Gary Miller who presided over the trial. &quot;I thought it was absolutely ridiculous for anybody to think that was an appropriate way to modify a sentence in this case.&quot;Wyser said he agreed to the modification due to rehabilitation and family concerns.&quot;It was the right thing to do. It was based upon the merits. I would do it again.&quot;Paula Epperly Willoughby's father is Harrison Epperly, a millionaire real estate magnet with property in downtown Indianapolis. From 2006 through 2008, Epperly donated $29,000 to the Brizzi campaign. $20,000 was donated the weekend before Brizzi's budget busting re-election in 2006. Those were the years his daughter's attorney was negotiating with Brizzi's office for a sentence modification.&quot;In April of 2009 Miss Lukemeyer and I drafted an order for the court modifying her sentence,&quot; said Wyser.On May 29, 2009, less than a month before Epperly Willoughby's motion for reducing her sentence would be filed with the court, Harrison Epperly donated $2500 to Wyser's campaign for Hamilton County prosecutor.&quot;I understand the timing may not look good to some people,&quot; said Wyser. &quot;It depends on how you want to put a spin on it.&quot;Epperly Willoughby was released from the Indiana Women's Prison in early July. On August 25th her attorney Jennifer Lukemeyer sponsored a fundraiser for Wyser at her downtown Indianapolis condominium. Wyser raised $2250 that night. In a statement to Fox 59 News Lukemeyer said the Wyser fundraiser, &quot;is not a story as far as it relates to Paula.&quot;Wyser and Brizzi told Fox 59 News that in the last week they have returned the donations to Epperly and his company EMPS LLC. The decision to return the money coincided when word of the Fox 59 investigation leaked through the city's legal community.At this time there is no investigation by any legal authorities into the circumstances surrounding Paula Epperly Willoughby's early release from prison.indiana politics civil rights law</body></row>

<body>After several hours of accounting and economics earlier in the day, the City Council and senior city administrators' budget retreat has progressed into a more aethereal realm: strategic planning.
Right now, they're on the city's mission statement.
The city has a mission statement? A good many city employees probably aren't aware of it either, observed Mayor Pro Tem Cora Cole-McFadden. So, for the record, here it is:
The City of Durham is dedicated to improving the quality of life in our community by delivering cost-effective highly responsive services with integrity and friendliness
&quot;I think it's a mouthful,&quot; said councilman Farad Ali.


To make City Hall's strategic-planning plan perfectly clear, the Web site is going live momentarily: http://www.durhamnc.gov/strategicplan/index.cfm</body></row>

<body>They say celebrity deaths, airplane crashes, and PR challenges at Durham City hall come in threes. Don't believe me? At the Durham Police Department, of late we've had the overtime scandal, the arrest of an officer indicted for allegedly selling crack cocaine, and the arrest this week of an officer for the alleged break-in and intimidation of a Wake Forest household. But the wheels of controversy have been turning around some vehicle purchases, too. Two stories have made the headlines this week: the Independent Weekly's revelation that the City spent $180,000 on two yard waste and bulky trash collection vehicles, only to jettison both of them with barely any use -- and at a $124,000 loss on a nearly $180,000 purchase price -- after they were found to be unfit for use. So, too, has the City Council's interest in giving five ready-for-surplus vehicles to the tiny, impoverished town of Princeville, still reeling from Hurricane Floyd a decade ago. Durham's municipal coffers will forego...

It's one of those stories that holds in amber a moment of tremendous change, the kind you look back on and say, &quot;Oh, so that's how it all began.&quot; And it was already a few years into the shift.In the article, a 19-year-old prostitute and neighborhood local named Venus talks about how the coming gentrification had already “messed business up. There are a lot more yuppies with kids here now. I mean, we were here first, but I don’t want to be out here working with kids around.”According to a meatpacker named DeStefano, the city leaders “don’t have time for us. They want everybody to wear a suit.” And meatman Adolf Kusy said, “The city’s giving us abuse. Greenwich Village is slowly creeping in from the east. Chelsea is coming south. They’d love to turn this into a new SoHo.”photos: Christian Witkin; Daniela Stallinger“But,” wrote Pincus, “it will take more than economic and political pressure to wash away the two centuries of blood that meatpackers have spilled on these streets.”Sadly, he was wrong.Still, there was a brief moment when it was all okay. When the Calvin Klein models and the interior designers co-existed peaceably with the transgender sex workers and leather boys, who all mixed well with the meatpackers. As one meatguy put it, “We’re unloading pigs, and the gays and whatnot are walking by. This is what makes New York great. I’m sitting in my office at 3 A.M., and the music from Jackie 60 vibrates through the floor, up my chair, and up my butt. It’s a great mix.”The article notes the neighborhood’s still-thriving eccentrics. Like Andrew Crispo, a bankrupt art dealer acquitted of the Death Mask murder, a “night crawler with a proclivity for S&amp;M.” There was “Gene, a curmudgeonly septuagenarian waitress with an airborne hairdo” and “her own cult following.” And someone called Tiny, “the tranny-chasing midget meat-worker and nightclub fixture.”It was all there in 1997. A neighborhood still alive, still on the cusp. Apparently, it all could have gone in a very different direction.photo: Christian Witkin, 1997The porn industry was also looking to move in at that time. Wrote Alex Williams in a follow-up article in the same issue of New York, the future of the meatpacking district could have gone one of two ways: “It could be the next SoHo. It could be the next Eighth Avenue. The uncertainty is as exhilarating as it is scary.”People weren’t so sure it could be another SoHo. Tom Duane worried about adult bookstores proliferating here. “How do you ‘gentrify’ a ‘meat market’?” asked Williams, “Who wants to step over bloody cow femurs in a new pair of Manolo Blahniks?”We now know the answer to those questions, too, but at the time, they didn't have a crystal ball.Said one meatpacker, “You ever been there at night? That’s not a shopping area. You wouldn’t put a Waldbaum’s there. In one place you get tied up and spanked. In another, you can get punished. That’s a neighborhood for people who are on the edge.”my flickr, 2010In 2010, that's no longer true. The meatpackers, leather queers, eccentrics, and transgender sex workers have been banished. Most recently, we saw the city tear down Novac Noury's bizarre funhouse, an eyesore in the Standard Hotel's view.You know the rest of the story, I don't have to tell it. But just think of what might have been. What if the porn industry had moved in before 2000? What if the armies of Manolos never came marching over those bloody femurs? We might still have a piece of sexy, eccentric, mixed-up New York, right here in Manhattan.my flickrAlso see:Lenny in LeatherMen in LeatherFood Fetish FightPigs in Shit</body></row>

<body>Image of Grog Shop From Spatial DesignA reader last month asked What Has Happened To Roosevelt Island's Grog Liquor Shop which elicited resident responses ranging from complaints about the quality of the store and inventory selections to supporters.An update - several readers have noticed a Tax Compliance Seizure sign on the door of the Grog Shop including this report from yesterday: I just walked by the Grog Shop and the Department of Taxation (or whatever its correct name is)  seized the property. There are big red signs in the windows saying that the Grog Shop has not been paying due taxes. Another open store front on Main Street.Roosevelt Island Grog Shop Seizure Sign on WindowI inquired of Roosevelt Island Operating Corp (RIOC) President Steve Shane: Several readers have reported that signage is up on the Grog Shop window stating that the store has been closed by Tax Authorities and worried that another Main Street store will be vacant.Do you have any details on the Grog shop closure and whether it will re-open? Has the Grog Shop surrendered it lease?Mr. Shane replied: The NY State Department of Taxation &amp; Finance closed the Grog Shop and changed the locks yesterday.The lease has not been surrendered, nor is it under any legal obligation to do so.I have asked the principal proprietor to call me to discuss the situation. It is unfortunate as to the community's needs for a retail service establishment. RIOC will do what it can to restore the service as soon as possible.</body></row>

<body>Musicals are the new black, apparently, with the Alain Chamfort production about Yves Saint Laurent being released before the end of 2010 and now, Sex Pistols-mastermind Malcolm McLaren cooking up a stage interpretation of Christian Dior's life. When it comes down to it, the life and times of iconic fashion designers would likely lend themselves well to musical theater -- it's not much of a stretch to believe that YSL and Dior cultivated respective realities that resembled the spectacle of the stage. We'd be delighted to sit back and take in numbers in YSL's Moroccan abode or the decades of legendary muses that surrounded these men.  The fashion documentary had its reign in 2009; 2010 is the year of the musical.</body></row>

<body>This isn’t quite real estate related, but if you’re a female in the interior design/real estate world, you’ve heard of Liberty of London. The iconic British textile company is known for its floral prints, which pop up everywhere from the runway to the bedroom. Liberty has been around since 1875, and has an archive of over 43,000 print designs, some of which they’re resurrecting for a new line at Target!
Target is known for snagging the best designer collaborations. In the fashion realm, they’re worked with Rodarte, the late and great Alexander McQueen, Erin Fetherston, and soon, Zac Posen and Jean Paul Gaultier. In the realm of interior design, they’ve partnered with Shabby Chic and Dwell Studio. Now, the budget retailer is adding Liberty of London to their impressive resume!
Starting on March 14th, your local Target store will be flooded with Liberty goodies ranging from $10-$200. Most pieces will be under $20, with a quilt costing $70 and a floral beach cruiser ringing in at $200. The designs will feature the British brand’s iconic micro-floral prints on bedding, gardening tools, planters, piggy banks, lamps, candles, storage boxes, ceramic and melamine dishes, and even a bicycle!
Mark the 14th of March on your calendars, stat! While you’re dreaming of filling your home with Liberty goodies, why not peruse Condo Domain’s database of New York condos? Hey, it doesn’t hurt to dream big! Right now, we’re crushing on a home in the quaint looking Glass Townhouse in the West Village. Click here to tour the property!</body></row>

<body>Back in the 80's, a teeny tiny Etienne Aigner shop opened in my teeny tiny southern Indiana village. Within days it was like someone had dropped an A bomb all over town. Of course everyone call it &quot;H N Ag Ner&quot; which made me crazy but I was always pretentious french speaking bitch anyway. The brand is quite distinctive with it's excellent quality oxblood red leather. I found this unusual doctors style bag thrifting and wanted to keep it but it's not big enough for all my crap. Currently, Aigner  has been revitalized and you can find it, sadly rarely in red, at TJ Max and Macy's</body></row>

<body>OK here's the rundown. Taiwanese street food doesn't seem to fare well in SF Bay Area as a collective. It doesn't attract massive crowds on its own, and the better places that do or did them are so scattered.

It's slim pickins in SF city proper. There's Taiwan restaurant on Clement Street but I do not vouch for its authenticity, even though you might find Taiwanese style ba wan (meat rice ball) there or beef noodle soup. But their fried cruller dough sticks are decent.

Taste of Formosa seems to be ok from what I hear of friends, though everyone raves about their tsong dzua bing (green onion shredded pancake). It's also on Clement street. They have oyster pancakes too.

Spices I and II (also on Clement) do Taiwanese style Sichuan, only if you are into numbing spicy and stinky tofu spicy hotpots. Also very greasy.

There's also Tea Garden (never been) and it is supposedly run by a Taiwanese couple, but whatever street food fare you get is varied. Authentic? Probably not close. It's a quick bite for most in that part of town, maybe not a destination spot.

Peninsula:

5 Joy in Foster City is a Taiwanese run restaurant that serves mostly mixed Northern style fare that comprise mostly of some Sichuan, ZiJiang/Shanghainese, and perhaps two other regions I can't remember. They do serve a little bit of street food fare, but it's part of the larger main menu. While the place is 20+ years old, it attracts a very steady and loyal clientele, as the restaurant does Chinese food that caters to Taiwanese tastebuds (and does it very well). They have oyster noodles on the weekend, though I have not had it. The gua bao is OK, but thin on the contents, definitely unlike a typical place in Taipei that specializes it that make it as big as a double cheeseburger for US$1.50. No oyster pancake. Minced pork rice? Yes...quite good. Stinky tofu is not bad and they have the steamed version too. It's Taiwanese....but at the same time the food isn't entirely.

Never been, but if you look at Yelp pictures, it's basically what you want more or less all under one roof. This location used to be owned by the US branches of Ay Chung noodle (franchised from Ay Chung Flour Rice Noodle Taipei / Ay Chung Mien Sien or http://www.ay-chung.com/ ) then something caused the franchise to go south, and then there were two ownership changes. Something tells me this place is likely the most authentic out of everything listed here. From the pix alone I see oyster pancake, stinky tofu, beef noodle soup, fried chicken roll (ji juern), ba wan/rou wan, oyster noodle, sausage rice, pork chop rice.

South Bay (San Jose, Cupertino and environs)

Southland Flavor Cafe

This place offers a huge menu, almost everything you've mentioned, and more, including Tainan style food. Cash only.

Taiwan Bistro

San Jose, CA 95130

TB is another choice to hit and probably better than Southland for the street food fare.

This is another place that would have it. Not too far down from there is Tai Kee Won Ton, supposedly a &quot;branch&quot; of the one out of Hualien Eastern Taiwan, but includes a huge assortment of typical Taiwanese rice plate, marinated snack eats and misc dishes.

Bottom line, the better stuff requires driving out of SF to get to.

With regards your question of breads/buns? Are you looking for a Taiwanese bakery?</body></row>

Despite Leda's departure from her days as a performer, a Dionysian musician from her past, The Stranger, refuses to release her.  While Leda mourns the death of her infant child, she confronts the chaos and desire The Stranger brings over the course of one wild weekend. For macrobiotic food, Souen is where you can get plenty of soy, seitan, tofu, and even fish that is insanely healthy and beautifully prepared, not to mention inexpensive. Though Antarctica is freakin’ cold, the bar is not. In fact, the interior will make you feel warm inside as it’s 276 years old, and with an all-wood interior and brick wall, this establishment serves up cheap beer with no attitude. Possibly one of the best sandwich shops in the city, Alidoro has 40 kinds of amazing Italian sandwiches, all named.</body></row>

<body>Eataly in Turin, Italy. 		News of the day: Delaware brewer Dogfish Head has announced that it’ll be involved in an 8,000-square-foot rooftop brewery and restaurant atop Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich’s flatiron food center Eataly, which opens this summer. The concept: Food by Batali paired with beers from Italian and American craft brewers. Here’s the part of the release that can be condensed to read “Best Idea Ever.” 		

The rooftop bar and restaurant will house a copper-clad brewing system. The idea is to create an artisanal, old world Italian craft brewery that just happens to be located on a rooftop in Manhattan, says Dogfish Heads Sam Calagione. The four brewers are working together on recipes for Eatalys house beers. Those beers will feature Italian and American ingredients. The beers will be unpasteurized, unfiltered, naturally carbonated, and hand-pulled through traditional beer engines for the most authentic and pure presentation. The four individual brewers will also occasionally brew beers under their own names on site. The rooftop restaurant project will pair artisanal rustic, homemade beers with the artisanal, rustic cooking of Chef Mario Batali. Additional Italian and American regional craft beers will be served both at the rooftop bar and within the downstairs restaurants.

And with this, the Shake Shack finally has some competition for the best outdoor eatery in and around Madison Square Park.

<body>Before the Pleasure Chest was a sex-toy stop on the Sex &amp; the City tour of Greenwich Village, right between Magnolia Bakery and the Perry Street stoop, it was a hardcore sex shop. At least it appears to be in the 1972 documentary  &quot;Pornography in New York.&quot;1972, Pornography in New YorkOpened in 1972, the Pleasure Chest was located at 183 West 10th Street, its incredibly slender space wedged between two buildings, where a boutique called Laura Lobdell jewelry is today. The little corner has cleaned up since the 70s and so has the Pleasure Chest.today, Google mapsIn the documentary, we're greeted by a sign warning customers that the novelties in this shop have not been approved by Good Housekeeping, the Department of Agriculture, nor the Board of Health.Pornography in New YorkNext we view a wooden shingle-covered wall hung with black leather wrist and ankle restraints, nipple clamps, and weights dangling from heavy chains. The Pleasure Chest still sells restraints, but these days they're more likely to be &quot;Rhinestone Glamour Cuffs.&quot;Pornography in New YorkOn the next wall, we see some dildos that are decidedly not cute or cuddly, along with a box full of cock rings, some made of leather lined with internal spikes. No pink feather boas here. No pink bunny-rabbit vibrators, either.Pornography in New YorkMaybe there were pink-bunny vibrators at the original Pleasure Chest. I don't know. They're not shown in the documentary. Still, somehow, I doubt it.Looking at these images compared to today, we see that sex toys in 1972 New York were gritty, rugged objects to be slipped into the slippery basements of the old Meat Market, not flaunted atop glittery glass towers in the new MePa.One last detail: The Pleasure Chest also sold water beds.Read More:Sex Toys &amp; The CityAdult BookstoresWith thanks again to Mick Dementiuk</body></row>

<body>Riccardo Buitoni isn't an Italian-American chef raised in an Italian family on American soil.? He's the real deal.? Born in Piedmont, Italy, he learned his craft on Italian soil, making fresh pasta with his mother. ? His first cooking job was at a local restaurant in his hometown.? From there, Buitino cooked his way through London, with a stint at a five-star restaurant in Sardinia, before landing in New York in Tocqueville's kitchen.?? Buitino fell in love with Williamsburg and opened Aurora, his flagship restaurant in Brooklyn before it was fashionable to do so.? His innovative, regional cooking quickly earned critical attention over dishes, like chestnut pappardelle with wild boar ragu, roasted cauliflower fontina cheese fondue, and fresh bread baked daily.? ?A few years later, he opened a Manhattan outpost in Soho with ambitious Piedmont cooking, including his mother's recipe for slow-braised tripe.??? His newest venture, is a Roman trattoria called Emporio located in Soho, is his best work to date.? Roman-style pizzas are his forte.? These wafer thin crust pizzas come with everything from house-cured pancetta to pesto to rosemary.? I highly recommend you begin dinner with his anchovy and buffalo mozzarella-stuffed zucchini blossoms. ? ?? ??? 
Single/Married/Divorced?Married.What did you want to be when you grew up?I wanted to be a fashion designer.? I had 5 years of technical studies in textile design in Italy.What was your first job in food?? What did you learn?It was in London at The Harbor Club.? Cooking for the royal family was exactly the same as cooking for a regular customer.You’re not an Italian American chef.? You’re the real deal, born in Piedmont.? What food memories do you have from childhood??? Are there any specific dishes you’ve integrated into your menus?? Making fresh pasta every Sunday with my mum. That is why fresh pasta is on all of my menus.When did you move to the states and what was your first cooking job?I moved here in 2002 and my first job was at Tocqueville in Union Square. How did you decide to open a restaurant of your own and how did you to choose Brooklyn for Aurora?I loved Williamsburg at first sight. I was living close by and the location was my partners’ idea, but it felt like a good challenge. We liked the vibe of the place and the idea of opening a destination place.Aurora became not only a neighborhood favorite, but also attracted Manhattanites to cross the bridge for dinner.? What were you doing with Italian that others weren’t at the time?We used real ingredients and real flavor, I guess.? The first 2 years, I was working almost 7 days a week.? We made everything on the premises from bread to pasta to sausages etc. and we still do.How’s Aurora Soho different from the original?It’s a different set up and the location is much smaller and doesn’t have a garden, but it’s very cozy and a little more refined.You're often seen having a glass of wine during service.? What’s your philosophy in the kitchen?I’m not very calm at all.? I’m not a screamer, but I take my job very seriously and I hate mistakes due to lack of attention. Yes, I love a glass of wine during service. But, I’m the only one allowed to do so.What inspired you to open a Roman trattoria that specialized in pizza in the opening of Emporio,.? Can we find you in the kitchen at Emporio these days or do you jump around every night?? Do you have a favorite?The Roman pizzeria was always our dream.? My partners are from Rome and we like a thin crust pizza because we like to have more than one pizza.Lately I’m more often at Emporio for service. It’s new and needs more adjustments, but I spend at least two hours with my chefs of the other two restaurants to discuss specials, menu planning and special events.What was it like opening Emporio without a liquor license?? Was that a tough obstacle and did you see a big change in business when you got one?...</body></row>

<body>I've always thought it a shame that the only business concern with a presence on picturesque, lovely, crooked Minetta Street is the cheesy Mexican restaurant Panchito's, whose main entrance in on the tourist-and-B&amp;T-laden Macdougal Street. How nice it would be if the 1950s-60s beatnik haven The Fat Black Pussycat still held the address.There's still evidence of the Pussycat's former tenancy. The coffee bar's name is painted in faded black letters on Minetta Street just above the garishly red Panchito's back entrance. To the right of the words, in script, is the word &quot;theatre,&quot; for, indeed, the Pussycat added a?148-seat cafe theatre in 1962. The cafe was owned by?Tom Ziegler, who was also proprietor of the nearby (and recently departed) Cafe Figaro. The cafe opened in 1958 at The Commons. It was a big part of the beatnick, bongos, espresso culture that thrived in the Village back then. It had?poetry readings, folk music and jazz and espresso, along with a languid, Bohemian ambiance. The Pussycat name was adopted after the expansion in 1962.Among the performers the Pussycat showcased were Tiny Tim, Mama Cass Elliot, Richie Havens, Bill Cosby and Shel Silverstein. The place had a short life when you think of it; it became Panchito's in 1972 and has been such ever since. Yet, the Pussycat is a legend and Panchito's, well, isn't.If you walk a block to W. 3rd Street, you might be fooled into thinking that the Big Black Pussycat lives. For right there at No. 130 is a bar and club with that very name, in the space that used to be the Kettle of Fish, a Kerouac hangout back in the day. As far as I can tell, however, the place has no connection to the original Pussycat; perhaps they bought the rights to the name. It's owned by Noam Dworman,?whose family also owns the Comedy Cellar and Café Wha?Confused yet? I know I am.</body></row>

<body>Free newspapers could soon be able to carry public government notices under legislation being considered at the Capitol.
Right now, state law requires that only newspapers with paid circulation be used for official government advertisements.
That's caused problems in mountain resort communities where free papers have become more common. Some local governments now have to post ads in outside newspapers that aren't read in their communities to follow the law.
The proposal has already passed the House and cleared a committee vote in the Senate on Wednesday.
It's backed by the Colorado Press Association and the Colorado Municipal League.

<body>Ok, so I just got back from the United Methodist Church book sale (see all the shit I bought above).
A couple of things to note: its totally fucking overcrowded, and you're gonna have to fight an overwhelming compulsion to flee from the moment you arrive. People are either pushy (and have no problemo shoving you straight into the table as they need to jam their fat ass by you into a corner where there's no room for them in the first fucking place) or clueless (and standing there in the worst possible spot they could be blocking 19,000 people as they bounce a cute lil bebe on their hip waiting for their wife to finish picking up her new stash of bodice ripper romance novels). Both are equally annoying. But if you can just resist the urge to run off to 7th Ave Donuts and persevere: its worth it if you can put in the time.
Probably my No. 1 decorating technique is to use books--piles of them in all sorts of interesting spots around our apartment. And so, I'm pretty much judging every book I see in that mofo sale by its cover...like literally. I'm obsessed with vintage coffee table books, old covers with interesting typography, books in non-traditional shapes, as well as books in other languages. And at a sale like this, where there's not much of anything over $4, its totally worth it for me to buy a cool book based on looks alone--guess I'm superficial like that. So, yeah: mostly everything I got today falls into this &quot;pretty book&quot; category, but now I've got loads of gorge new shit to use to freshen up some of our stacks.
I might even go back again tomorrow, because they really are replenishing stuff all day.
I spent $21 and here's what I ended up with:

Atlas Historique et Culturel de L'Europe - big, beautiful European history coffee table book in French.
The New Yorker Album of Drawings 1925-1975 - oversized coffee table book filled with all the b&amp;w drawings that appeared in the New Yorker mag.
New York: A Picture Memory - Published in 1989, there's lots of great/sad Twin Towers photos in here.
Time Out London: Shops &amp; Services 2007 - ok, yes this mofo is probs out-of-date, but for $1.50, I'm guessing there's still lots of good shit in there. And I love, love, love London.
The Playboy Interviews - This might be my fave find. It was published in 1981 and includes classic Playboy interviews with all sorts of amazing peeps like John Wayne, Fidel Castro, Jimmy Carter, Martin Luther King Jr. (!?) and Miles Davis.
Word Play - no clue wtf this book is, except I loved the pink/brown typography on the cover (and it was a cute square shape).
Das Glasperlenspiel - I don't speak a word of German, but this cover was cool.
Der Sachfenfpiegel - Ditto.
Picasso - Small, colorful, square, art book of some of his paintings/drawings.
Le Petit Chose
Claudine en Menage
Claudine a Paris - 3 gorgeous little French paperbacks, all with beautiful covers.
The Explorer's Guide: Hudson Valley &amp; Catskill Mountains - I have regular, ridiculous fantasies of buying a little weekend house somewhere, and this book? has a great roundup of lots of little towns.
Book I'm too embarrassed to include

Lastly, I picked up a book for Allison. As she's reminded us like 17 times last week, she's been stuck at home with her kids on some sort of long, drawn out spring break bullshit, and it kinda seemed like she could use a distraction (she's been so desperate to get out, she's been asking me to babysit for Christ's sake). So I got her this paperback: Blood Red Rose by Maxwell Grant. It's &quot;a grand, sweeping tale of forbidden love and divided loyalty in the vast landscape of China.&quot;
Here's mostly why I chose this book:

I love when you don't even have to bother reading the little blurb about a book to understand that everyone in this mofo is gettting laid...like a lot.
So, yeah: Happy Spring Break, Allison! [I can leave the book out in front of our building in a totally not embarrassing unmarked paper bag if you'd like?].</body></row>

Now, the chickens might be coming home to roost for Lowy, who will face challenger Ira Cure when the club hold’s its election on Feb. 18. “The leadership wants Kenn out to keep the club from splitting,” said a person familiar with the goings on of the club. “They tried to get Lowy to step aside, as a means to heal the wounds, but he would not,” the person said. “Will he survive? Probably not.”</body></row>

<body>Stephin Merritt at Town Hall, March 2008 (courtesy of houseoftomorrow.com) 


To say Stephin Merritt of The Magnetic Fields, among other projects, is an enigmatic guy is one of the most clichéd descriptions in modern music. While that may be, based on our recent phone call with Merritt, that description also proves itself to be one of the most apt clichés we’ve ever had a chance to confirm firsthand. In advance of The Magnetic Fields’ two-night stint at Town Hall, we were able to get him to answer some of our questions, while also getting quite a music lesson in the process.

With the other Washington (DC), getting its own anthem from 69 Love Songs, what are the odds of you immortalizing this Washington with a Magnetic Fields song of our own?

I wouldn’t write a song about Seattle because I wouldn’t want to compete with a classic. Everybody knows the Bobby Sherman song.

Fair enough. Are there any sites or activities you look to take in while in the area?

I'm terrible with names of theatres. I remember the names of restaurants or locations anyway. Restaurant I’m eager to go to above the ZigZag bar around the corner from Pike’s Place market. I forgot the name of the restaurant but I’ll look it up in the Zagat guide.

Throughout your career, you’ve been known to experiment with quite a few instruments outside of what one typically hears in Western music. What was the process of instrumentation for Realism?

For this album, I made a chart of what songs have which instruments in them because I didn’t want to be duplicating that. Other than accordion and cello, no two instruments are on more than two songs together. That was a bit of a logistical nightmare but it worked out.

This is actually a reaction, as is much of the record, against Distortion which has the same instrumentation on every song.

Did you get the idea for Realism before finishing Distortion or did this idea for creating a ying to Distortion’s yang come to you later in the process?

I’d written almost all of Distortion before we started recording it. And before I decided on the production style. I’d written all but one of the songs on Distortion without having this idea of the ying and yang as you put it. When I decided on the production style, that’s when I decided the next record would be a folk record.  		 			 				 	 	 	In the liner notes of 69 Love Song you talk quite a bit about clichés in music. Can you expand on that and discuss how this affects your approach to songwriting?

All of Western music is one big clichéd territory. You can’t get out of it, you can only turn around and look at it. As long as you’re going to us Western tonality, you’re limited to the 12 notes per minute. That’s one big cliché and it’s a cliché for a reason. Within that paradigm when we hear non-Western music, it may sound to us like a cliché. Like, “oh, that clichéd music you always hear in Indian restaurants.” Because we’re ignorant of their own, much larger set of clichés. Which they probably don’t think of as clichés but as modes or structures. They’ll hear our 12 notes over and over again as a cliché. Or our bass, high hat, snare, high hat, bass, high hat, snare, high hat as a cliché. We just see it as a structure. An extremely common structure.

I think abandoning tonality entirely would be more attractive to me, which I did a lot on in Eban &amp; Charley's soundtrack, which is largely vaguely tuned percussion.

Are there any modern artists that you listen to regularly?

I listen to almost nothing contemporary. I usually listen to music before 1950. When I DJ, I have a period from 1964 to 1971 where I play bubblegum and psychedelic music.

What’s next for you and the band?

I’ll be touring for two months. Then on May 4 in San Francisco I’m doing a large score for the 1917 version of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea at the Castro Theatre with the Castro organ, accordion and electronics. And hopefully, it’s going to be with singing.</body></row>

<body>A nice big NSFW piece from the show is on the jump.Meet Matthew Cooke, a Stranger reader who has vowed to do everything The Stranger suggests for the entire month of February. Look for his reports daily on Slog and Line Out. —Eds.
Christ, it’s nice outside. Seattle has had an epic few days weather-wise and yesterday you could feel the entire city greedily sucking up the sun-drenched afternoon like alcoholics falling off the wagon. Crocuses are popping, cherry trees are blooming, and even though a month of winter remains, people were spilling over with the bursting reemergence of warmth and light, shedding clothes and showing acres of pale flesh.
It was in this spirit of joyous exposure that I headed down to see De Kooning’s Women at Punch Gallery. Adding to my good mood was the company, Slog favorite and former Stranger copy mistress Amy Kate Horn.
Just as The Stranger described it, Joanna Thomas’s exhibit takes old advertisements for famous artists—all male—and superimposes cutouts of busty pin-up women, arranged in ways that poke fun at the self-seriousness and gender bias of art’s broader culture.
Honestly though, while Amy and I were both aware of the feminist implications of the show, what was most striking for us was the all-consuming power of nudity itself. There’s something about it that, at least initially, precludes any deep thought. All we can focus on is that someone is nude, and we are witnessing it.
And there’s something about breasts in particular. Go ahead and call me a brainless, sexist pig, but admit it: If there was a hot, gloriously naked woman next to the Mona Lisa, some period of time would pass before you’d even notice the painting. It would cease to exist. I don’t think it’s just a straight guy thing. Our reptilian brains see a pair of exposed breasts and the only thought we’re capable of, regardless of sexual orientation, is “Holy Schlamoley! Look at those freakin’ headlights!”
While the nudity issue itself probably wasn’t at the forefront of the artist’s intent, it was interesting to be so blatantly confronted with it and to take stock of our ensuing reactions. And yeah, it’s possible that the sunny day had me in a more glib and superficial mood than usual.
But so what? Nobody should apologize for being in a good mood in late February here in this gray and dark northern outpost of civilization. Spring has arrived early, and we should all be permitted, without shame, to extol the virtues of bare skin. Recommendation approved!

The Austin Toros have 3 - count 'em, three -?players in the All-Star game. ?Alonzo Gee(who also took part in the slam dunk contest last night), Dwayne Jones, and Curtis Jerrells are all deserving of their spots on the West team, especially with all the other players who were called up. ?Not only that, but Spurs fans who were around for summer league last year will notice one of the names on the East roster as well: ?Romel Beck. ?Yep, it seems like our favorite organization still has that famed eye for talent. ?Anthony Tolliver's name is a mystery to me - he's been with three NBA teams already this year, so I doubt he spent much time in the D-League.

Remaining events

The Shooting Stars competition will include former Spurs Brent Barry and Michael Finley Steve Smith, so that should hold some sentimental interest.
No Spurs or Spurs-related players are participating in any of the other events, but they should be fun to watch anyway.?

<body>It's actually quite difficult to find time to write when you're actually having fun doing different stuff all day long. I have a new appreciation for Wayne's work during his Las Vegas trip - that was something else. I would work as hard, I really would, but I have the perfect excuse: it's my freaking vacations.
Let's get to it.


  
Day 2
On My Own
I woke up early that Sunday, with absolutely no plans. Wayne wasn't going to come till Monday, Tom my host was away, too, and the other people I knew in SA were busy with life. So I decided to focus on fixing something of the utmost importance: my computer access. As I'd mentioned in my last post, being the hopeless newbie that I am I had no idea that the North American sockets had little to do with the ones used in Argentina these days. My battery had quickly run out the day before at Madhatter's, and I couldn't imagine life without PTR and Gmail for three whole weeks - especially while in Spursland. And yes, I know I'm sick.
I started walking looking for a Walgreen's. For the foreigners, Walgreen's are mini Walmarts, small supermarkets (is that an oxymoron?) in one of which I'd bought my pre-paid cellphone. I knew there was one nearby, but I had no idea where it was exactly. Armed with my brand new San Antonio map, I wasn't going to let that stop me. Thus I set out in the general direction of the Riverwalk and the Alamo, downtown San Antonio, asking people left and right where that elusive Walgreen's was, but no one was sure. In the meantime I crossed the Riverwalk two or three times, and took some photos - this is my attempt at being artistic like Hipuks.
Eatcher heart out, jolly
I finally found a Walgreen's (thanks to a drunk teenager, in fact), just opposite a Children's Museum that looked interesting - too bad I didn't have any little cousins to use as an excuse to visit it. It didn't have the adapter, but I was able to buy some stuff I'd forgotten: toothbrush, comb, etc. Did I mention I suck (tm) at traveling? I decided it was time to bring out the big guns, so I walked all the way to the Rivercenter Mall. As far as malls go, this one actually has an interesting design. It's shaped like an U, I believe, around the tail end of the Riverwalk, and there's a bridge connecting both wings.
Still, it's just a mall, and both malls and airports are universal constants across the world. I asked a random Hispanic guy I came across about the adapter, and he suggested a shop that was about to open. As I was waiting, 15 minutes later, he came up to me, waved, and told me to follow him. Apparently while he was buying for a cell phone he noticed the adapters on the wall and came to get me (across the entire mall) because he knew I needed it. If that's not some old fashioned Texan hospitality, I don't know what it is. Great guy.
I walked by the Alamo, but didn't go in because I'd already talked to Jane Ann (jannieannie) and we were going to go together with jollyrogerwilco and Ben, a friend of mine, the next day. You see, Jane Ann is a retired history teacher, so she can really make the old walls come alive when she's talking. But we'll get to that soon enough. In front of the Alamo you can find lots of funky shops, but I'd been warned against them. Ripley's Believe it or Not is there, and honestly it looked a bit silly from outside. What shocked me, though, was this kid's game:
&quot;Shocked me&quot;, get it? Hyu hyu
Seriously, how's that good for kids? An electric chair? Really? Even though you can't see it, the LED screen said something like &quot;Are you brave enough? Can you withstand it?&quot; Hell no, I can't resist electricity. I'm trying to imagine that being in an Argentinian arcade, and I just can't picture it. Maybe it's a local thing. Next to it was some sort of low quality wax museum, like Madame Tussauds' pauper son. The entrance featured three true American heroes: Superman, Bob Dylan and... Tiger Woods. So there it was, Wax Tiger, grinning at me, tirelessly waiting for the scandal to pass and his real self to don the leader's red one more. His smile was intoxicating.

<body>Lisa Fickenscher - Strip and night clubs in Times Square took a beating this week. Two hot spots, China Club and Cheetahs Gentlemen's Club &amp; Restaurant, are seeking bankruptcy protection and filed for Chapter 11. China Club's filing blamed the fall of Lehman Brothers for its financial troubles. Located on West 47th Street, just a few blocks from Lehman's former headquarters, the investment bankers were regular patrons. The club also said in the filing that business began declining in 2007. The club, a New York City institution since 1986 when it first opened on the Upper West Side, listed both assets and liabilities between $1 million and $10 million.Cheetah's does not have a storied past. But the club that opened in 2007 certainly has a story. It's known for serving all-you-can-eat sushi served on partially naked women. Trend-spotting newsletter Urban Daddy described the experience as the ancient Japanese art of nyotaimori, or &quot;female body presentation.&quot; Web site The G Manifesto described Cheetahs as one of the Top 10 strip clubs in New York.The owner, Larry Gribler, is apparently involved in litigation over ownership of the club and is considering selling it, according to his lawyer, Douglas Pick of Pick &amp; Zabicki. Mr. Gribler is president of Three Amigos SJL Inc., which is the corporate parent of the club. The Cheetahs bankruptcy filing also lists both assets and liabilities of between $1 million and $10 million. In 2008, Cheetahs reported revenues of $2.5 million, according to Mr. Pick.</body></row>

<body>Eloise will have to go hungry. 
  In a move that could be seen as the biggest black eye yet for the struggling Plaza hotel, its leading retail tenant is bolting and suing the developer for fraud. 
  The Demel Bakery, a famed Viennese patisserie, says it has struggled from Day One in a morguelike subterranean mall that has failed to attract other high-end retailers or shoppers. 
  The sole eatery in the 160,000-square-foot shopping area, the Demel could desert The Plaza within the next few weeks, sources said, breaking the 10-year lease it inked with the hotel in February 2008. Other retailers are grumbling that they'll follow suit. 
  The bakery accuses the hotel's developer, Elad Properties, of using &quot;bait-and-switch&quot; tactics to lure Demel to its grand concourse -- claiming it would be neighbors to luxury retailers like Harrods, Harvey Nichols, Louis Vuitton and Gucci, according to a scathing lawsuit filed last week in Manhattan Supreme Court. 
  Instead, the developer delivered a basement space &quot;populated with unknown . . . retailers or -- worse -- vacant, unleased space,&quot; the suit alleges. 
  &quot;Legally, you can't promise one thing, get somebody to make a commitment to you and then not deliver what you promised,&quot; attorney Y. David Scharf told The Post. &quot;That's called fraud. They pulled the rug out from under us.&quot; 
  The Plaza -- the fabled stomping grounds of the children's-book character Eloise -- was bought in 2004 by Israeli billionaire Isaac Tschuva, who owns Elad, for $675 million. As part of a $450 million renovation, the developer converted part of the hotel into 181 luxury condominiums and debuted the Plaza Retail Collection. 
  But real-estate brokers say the mall was a flop from the start. 
  &quot;They never marketed it right,&quot; said Faith Hope Consolo of Prudential Douglas Elliman. &quot;They should have given favorable deals to key retailers.&quot; 
  Of 181 condos at The Plaza, 29 are for sale and five for rent. 
  More than 10 owners have reportedly sold their condos at great losses. One owner ditched his three-bedroom for $8.5 million just 14 months after he paid $14.6 million for it. 
  &quot;The last thing I want to see is the Demel leave,&quot; said Fernando Alvarez, owner of the Qiviuk boutique, which sells clothing made from goat fur. &quot;We're having difficulties . . . They help get us foot traffic.&quot; 
  The Demel stopped paying rent to the Plaza in February 2009. 
  &quot;This lawsuit is a smokescreen,&quot; Plaza attorney Jay Neveloff said. &quot;Elad tried to reach out to the principals, but there was no communication. These tenants are doing well; they just don't want to pay their rent. Now we want them to pay or leave.&quot;
Suite and $our

* 29 of the 181 luxury condominiums are on the market, and there are five active rental listings, according to Streeteasy.com.
* Three condo owners have sued the developer for fraud and breach of contract.

Plaza Hotel

* Occupancy rates were down 20 percent in 2009. 
Event spaces

Plaza retail collection

* The Demel Bakery is suing The Plaza for fraud and is moving out within weeks.
* Luxury shirtmaker Eton of Sweden shuttered in September 2009.
* The high-end lingerie brand Marlies Dekker closed at the end of 2008.

<body>510arts.comThe tag line for 510Arts.com is &quot;World Culture in the East Bay.&quot; That's the first smart-marketing message being pushed by this online portal for artists and art organizations from the so-called East Bay Cultural Corridor, which comprises Berkeley, Emeryville, Oakland and Richmond. While San Francisco still draws larger crowds to its theaters, music halls and museums, the East Bay is where most artists live these days. There are now more than 6,000 professional artists working in the East Bay - increasingly in the more affordable cities of Emeryville and Richmond - as well as hundreds of nonprofit visual arts, music, dance and theater organizations, according to the four cities' cultural departments. Plus, the East Bay is the melting pot of the region; more than 150 languages are spoken there, with residents hailing from every corner of the globe.The online portal launched Oct. 2 as a public-private-community partnership, with sign-on from the cities' four mayors and funding from the East Bay Community Foundation, the San Francisco Foundation, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the James Irvine Foundation and Leveraging Investments in Creativity. The organization's goals are to help market local artists and arts institutions, forge relationships among them and use the arts as a catalyst for economic development.

<body>Charlotte Leaders, Peter Gorman, CMS Move Toward Lay-Offs, Maybe School ClosingsCharlotte-Mecklenburg Schools is moving ahead with plans to cut 880 jobs, and the board will need to decide in March whether to close schools to save money in 2010-11, Superintendent Peter Gorman said today.At a news conference this morning, Gorman said he’s moving forward on all four levels of cuts he presented last week. Those included eliminating 658 teacher jobs; making unspecified cuts to Central Administration, transportation and building maintenance; and eliminating middle-school sports.And he’s crunching numbers on more dire scenarios, such as closing underfilled schools, eliminating magnet busing and delaying the opening of two new high schools. In private talks with board members that have lasted two to 3 1/2 hours, Gorman has outlined which schools might face closing and how much that would save. Neither he nor board members have disclosed details.Big-city school districts across the country are planning to lay off teachers and close schools, as the recession lingers for another year.The board could still back away from some of the proposed cuts, but the district must move quickly to meet legal guidelines for some layoffs and to settle questions that affect staff and students.On Tuesday, Gorman told the board he’ll delay his formal budget proposal from March 9 to April 12, similar to what he did last year when faced with major cuts. The board will vote on a budget May 11 and present it to county officials later that week.Ultimately, the number of jobs cut depends on how much money the state and county provide – information that won’t be in hand until summer.Gorman said today the board must decide about closings, delays and major busing changes during three special budget meetings in March. He and several board members say keeping Hough and Rocky River high schools empty for a year is the least popular option, but there’s been no vote to eliminate that plan from consideration.Board members say they expect to see significant changes in the six regional administrative offices Gorman launched two years ago.Some have voiced interest in finding other ways to pay for middle-school sports, such as adding admission fees for those events or tacking a surcharge onto high-school tickets.CMS is competing with other agencies for scarce county money, and some members say they want to be more aggressive in asking for extra money to open the new high schools and deal with enrollment growth. But board chair Eric Davis says the talk of dire cuts isn’t posturing to pressure county commissioners.“This is not a game we’re playing,” he said.Video and written information about Charlotte-Mecklenburg budget planning are available on the district’s Web site. Gorman’s news conference will air on CMS-TV Cable 3 at 10 p.m. today and 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. Thursday.Harvard Study Details Charlotte Schools' EffectivenessHarvard University Researchers who have been studying a North Carolina school system to learn what makes teachers effective are reporting their findings.The Charlotte Observer reports that the Harvard researchers unveil on Tuesday what they've found out about Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools Teachers.Superintendent Peter Gorman has said previously that researchers found advanced degrees and experience make little difference in student achievement. Much more important is National Board Certification, a voluntary credential that requires intensive work on classroom techniques.The report also looks at whether certain education colleges produce more effective teachers, and which teachers are most likely to leave the county's public schools.View Larger MapSources: Harvard Unv., WRAL, WCNC, McClatchy Newspapers, Charmeck.org, Youtube, Google Maps</body></row>

<body>Dr. Peter Gorman was hired in 2006 as Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools' Superintendent.Since coming onboard he has worked diligently behind the scenes to Re-segregate Charlotte's Public School system.All of the De-Segregation efforts established by previous CMS Superintendents (Dr. Elmer Garinger , Dr. A. Craig Phillips, Dr. William Self, Dr. Rolland Jones, Dr. Jay Robinson, Dr. Peter Relic, Dr. John Murphy, Dr. Eric Smith, Dr. James L. Pughsley, Dr. Frances Haithcock) have basically been destroyed by Gorman.Well now he's using Charlotte's local Media (WBTV, WCNC, WSOC, Charlotte Observer) to do his dirty work in the form of Racial Fear Tactics and Twisted Educational Propaganda.He's claiming a Harvard University Study states Educators with Advanced Degrees don't really matter as it relates to Teacher Effectiveness. WTF??Even though Dr. Gorman and his Administrators have previously demanded Charlotte-Mecklenburg Teachers earn Advanced Degrees (Master's &amp; National Board Certification) in order to basically keep their jobs.Even though Dr. Gorman has previously bragged about the number of Charlotte Teachers who possess Advanced Degrees.Suddenly because President Obama has proposed changing the No Child Left Behind Act law, Peter Gorman cries wolf with this &quot;Teachers with Advanced Degrees don't make a difference in Education&quot; tall tale.While its true Advanced Degrees can't turn someone into a real Teacher (from the heart), Advanced Degrees do impact Teacher Effectiveness and Classroom Performance because Knowledge is Power.This is obviously Dr. Gorman's way of NOT complying with Pres. Obama's Educational Reform changes.Why?He simply doesn't want Minority Students to receive an Equal Education comparable to White Students.He's on an assigned mission to send more Southern White Students to College then Southern Black Students.Thus he wants Minority Students to continue underachieving so CMS can secure Federal Money and than use that money on White Students.(Dr. Peter Gorman is the same man Arne Duncan wanted to hire last year to help improve Public Schools nationwide. Can you believe it?)What's even more amazing is how the local NAACP, Charlotte Meck. School Board, Charlotte Meck. County Board of Commissioners, Charlotte City Council Members and Black Leaders have assisted Dr. Gorman in his deviant, divisive quest to further disadvantage Charlotte's Minority Students.But Wait!Whose mission and scheme to fraud the Federal Government is Dr. Peter Gorman carrying out in order to remain employed and continue in his role?Gov Bev Perdue, Jennifer Roberts (Democrat) and the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of County Commissioners!That's right because they hold Charlotte's purse strings.Since Jennifer Roberts is the Chairperson, she along with Gov. Bev Perdue (her political &quot;partner in crime&quot;) are both Guilty of disenfranchising Charlotte's Minority Students as it relates to them receiving an Equal Education.After all the more Minority Students who drop out of school, Gov. Perdue &amp; Jennifer Roberts can then procure more Federal Funding to waste and build Jails, Prisons to house them.Jennifer Roberts may attempt to spin a fake story about &quot;Budget Cuts&quot; to cover up her race-based malfeasance but don't believe her.In 2008 Jennifer Roberts allowed Charlotte-Meck's County Manager (Harry Jones) to create a unnecessary DSS job (during a Hiring Freeze) for his fellow Church Member and the wife of our current Mayor Anthony Foxx.This woman was paid a salary of $100,000 and worked on this job for little over a entire year. If Charlotte were truly hurting for money why did Jennifer Roberts allow this unnecessary job to be created?As you can see Jennifer appears to have no problem using Federal and Taxpayer Dollars to grant Political Favors but when it comes to educating Minority students, she often intentionally falls short.Just in case you weren't aware, Jennifer Roberts is an Educator within the UNC System.However I guess helping to ensure Minority Children receive an Equal education comparable to White Students isn't on her agenda.

<body>Obama Prods States To Raise Academic StandardsPresident Barack Obama prodded states Monday to raise their school standards by using his best leverage: money.Obama told governors he wants a change in law that would allow states to receive federal aid for poor students only if they adopt academic standards that are deemed to truly prepare children for college or careers out of high school.The move would require a change in the nation's main elementary and secondary education law, which became known as the No Child Left Behind Act during the presidency of George W. Bush.Traditionally, the federal government is a marginal player in the financing and control of education, but its role has expanded as educators and lawmakers at all levels worry about slipping U.S. competitiveness.Many schools count on a key source of Federal aid, known as Title I, to help out their poorest students. That's the money that Obama wants to make contingent upon the setting of more rigorous standards across the nation. It would remain up to states, not Washington, to choose their specific standards.Many states are already working on a united effort to coordinate and improve their standards.Yet Obama took a swipe at how some states responded to this challenge under No Child Left Behind, saying 11 states lowered their standards in math between 2005 and 2007.&quot;That may make those states look better relative to other states,&quot; Obama said, &quot;but it's not going to help our students keep up with their global competitors.&quot;Obama spoke to governors of both parties during their yearly gathering with the president at the White House.The White House said the Governors have been working on the president's Race to the Top program, which rewards school systems that raise standards and demonstrate commitment through tougher student assessments.At the same time, the White House said that too many states are churning out graduates who are unprepared either for college or career.In addition to supporting ongoing state efforts, the White House said the president will commit an additional $350 million to the Race to the Top challenge to back &quot;state-led partnerships to develop new, state-of-the art assessments aligned to college and career-ready standards.&quot;According to the White House, the president's 2011 budget will call for the Re-Authorization of the 1994 version of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which would require states to meet six tough standards to help high school graduates prepare for college or jobs. The White House said schools need to focus on better teacher preparation, improved teaching and tougher student assessments.The Elementary and Secondary Education Act was first passed in 1965 and has been routinely re-authorized every five years. Under the measure, federal money is sent to the states to pay for teacher development, instructional materials, educational resources and promotion of parental involvement.Obama's Re-Authorization would:—Require the states to adopt and certify that they have college-and career-ready standards in Reading and Mathematics&quot; to be eligible for the federal money.—Establish a $405 million outlay to help states &quot;align teacher preparation practices and programs to teaching of college- and career-ready standards.&quot;—Provide grants totaling $400 million to states that adopt tougher student assessment programs.—Dedicate $1.35 billion to the Race to the Top program in addition to stimulus money for the program.—Allot $2.5 billion in the 2011 budget to a state grant program to support better teaching and leadership in the schools.Layoffs Loom For Teachers: Education SecretaryMany teachers and educators across the United States are at risk of losing their jobs in the next few months, the nation's education secretary told a meeting of the National Governors Association on Sunday.&quot;I am very, very concerned about layoffs going into the next school year starting in September. Good superintendents are going to start sending out pink slips in March and April, like a month from now, as they start to plan for their budgets,&quot; said Arn...</body></row>

<body>10 Successful Governors Dodging Voter Anger As the nation’s governors gather in Washington for their annual winter meeting, many of them are confronting a grim picture: state budgets bathed in red ink, dwindling poll numbers and a toxic political environment back home that threatens not only their ability to govern effectively but also their political careers.Yet at the same time, a handful in each party remain above the fray, not simply surviving in an otherwise rough environment, but thriving.Among Democrats, Arkansas Gov. Mike Beebe boasts an approval rating that tops 80 percent — in a state where hostility to the national Democratic agenda and President Barack Obama is roiling state politics.Third-term New Hampshire Gov. John Lynch is poised to become the state’s longest-serving governor in the state in more than 200 years. In West Virginia, Gov. Joe Manchin III, who registered 78 percent approval in a September 2009 poll, is coming off the most dominant election margin for a governor in the state since the Civil War.First-term Delaware Gov. Jack Markell, recently tapped to head the Democratic Governors Association, and Wyoming Gov. Dave Freudenthal, who may run for an unprecedented third term., also possess enviable ratings.Republicans can point to their own chief executives who are floating above it all. Alaska Gov. Sean Parnell, who succeeded Sarah Palin in July, is viewed positively by more than 70 percent of voters, according to a new poll released Saturday. North Dakota Gov. John Hoeven, the longest serving governor in the nation, has through-the-roof poll numbers and is regarded as a shoo-in to win the state’s open Senate seat. Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman’s stellar numbers have him often mentioned as a potential challenger to Democratic Sen. Ben Nelson in 2012. and Govs. Bobby Jindal and Haley Barbour, of Louisiana and Mississippi, respectively, have unusually strong numbers, given their high-profile and often partisan roles.It’s no accident, governors and other close observers say, that the most popular governors at the moment tend to hail from smaller states, where governors are in closer touch — and have a more personal relationship — with voters, something that is critical to maintaining trust with an electorate that is frustrated and fearful of its economic circumstances.“Arkansas is conducive to creating a closer bond between a governor and a huge chunk of the electorate,” Beebe, a first-term Democrat who is cruising to reelection in November, told POLITICO in an interview Saturday. “And as a result of that, if you do it right, you start to form personal allegiances that can transcend mistakes and can transcend differences and can overcome obstacles — and I think I’m the beneficiary of that.”“You develop interpersonal relationships with people closer than you can do in a state with 25 million people. I mean, the governor of Texas can’t have the kind of significant relationship with the huge amount of the electorate that a governor of Arkansas can.”The political circumstances in the nation’s largest states underscore Beebe’s contention. Texas Gov. Rick Perry is currently fighting off several challengers in a competitive three-way GOP primary March 2. California GOP Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is staring down a debilitating budget deficit and is estranged from both parties. New York Gov. David Paterson, whose poll numbers have plummeted since assuming office in 2008, is considered so wounded that even the White House weighed in to encourage him not to seek election to a first full term.Other big-state governors are similarly wrestling with challenges that have limited their effectiveness. In Illinois, Gov. Pat Quinn, still saddled with the taint from his predecessor Rod Blagojevich, narrowly fended off a Democratic primary challenger earlier this month. Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, once considered a lock to win an open Florida Senate seat, suddenly finds himself in a GOP primary dogfight. Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm, who has been forced to confront the state’s staggeringly high unemployment rate, has ...</body></row>

<body>Do you really believe Pres. Obama's Stimulus plan has created or saved jobs? Well.....Here is further proof the Stimulus success rate  was a lie fabricated by the Mainstream Media and that it did NOT save Teaching Jobs in North Carolina.Last year after Pres. Obama signed the Recovery Act into law he dished out $8.1B to North Carolina Governor Bev Perdue (Democrat).After gladly accepting it what did Gov. Perdue do with her state's share? Due to North Carolina's $4B plus deficit caused by previous Wasteful Democrat Spending and Corruption, she appears to have helped balance the state's budget.Where's the rest of it? North Carolina citizens have no idea. Just like we don't know where hundreds of millions in N.C. Education Lottery money went. (We guess it just disappeared into thin air.)Instead of saving Teacher Jobs Gov. Perdue ordered North Carolina Public School Superintendents to slash millions in Educational funding, not excluding Teachers. Especially Teachers working in Low Income schools.The result? Thousands of North Carolina Teachers lost their jobs.Many of them were Fired ILLEGALLY and appealed to get their jobs back.(Evidence and Data to substantiate this post can be obtained from CMS, N.C. Dept of Ed., U.S. Dept of Ed., etc., via the Freedom of Information Act.)What has the Obama Administration done to stop this unjust travesty? ?NOTHING!Why?He obviously hopes to win North Carolina again in 2012, so he is basically selling out North Carolina Teachers and Minority Students for Political Gain. (&quot;Pay for Play&quot;)Did the Mainstream Media report any of this? NO! They refused to because they didn't want Pres. Obama to appear as a Liar or Incompetent.Please know those N.C. Teachers were NOT laid-off for Poor Performance reasons.To the contrary because they were all Certified and most possessed Master Degrees.In addition about 97% of them had previously received Excellent Evaluations.They were laid-off because Gov. Bev Perdue used the Stimulus money to her discretion (personal political gain) and due to obvious Racism (just review her past &amp; present policies), it didn't matter if Minority students failed because of unnecessary Teacher lay-offs.You see the more Minority Students drop out of school and commit crimes, the more Minority citizens she can help imprison in North Carolina Prisons for LIFE!Even if they commit Non-Homicidal, Non Drug Related Crimes.Well this year Gov. Bev Perdue is planning to do the exact, same thing. (Fire Teachers unnecessarily)Thousands more North Carolina Teachers are expected to lose their jobs before August 2010.Does anyone care? It doesn't look like it.In fact more Teacher Lay-offs are currently in the planning stages for many, many Charlotte-Mecklenburg Teachers.I'm about to expose another prime example of how the Stimulus plan isn't working well in North Carolina and how N.C. Politicians/ N.C. Education Officials are using this Recession as an excuse NOT to educate Minority Students.Ever since Dr. Peter Gorman was hired in 2006 as Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools' Superintendent, he has worked diligently behind the scenes to Re-segregate Charlotte's Public School system.All of the De-Segregation efforts established by previous CMS Superintendents (Dr. Elmer Garinger , Dr. A. Craig Phillips, Dr. William Self, Dr. Rolland Jones, Dr. Jay Robinson, Dr. Peter Relic, Dr. John Murphy, Dr. Eric Smith, Dr. James L. Pughsley, Dr. Frances Haithcock) have basically been destroyed by Gorman's Racist regime.(Dr. Peter Gorman is the same man Arne Duncan wanted to hire last year to help improve Public Schools nationwide. Can you believe it?)What's even more amazing is how the local NAACP, Charlotte Meck. School Board, Charlotte Meck. County Board of Commissioners, Charlotte City Council Members and Black Leaders have assisted Dr. Gorman in his deviant, divisive quest to further disadvantage Charlotte's Minority Students.But Wait!Whose mission is Dr. Peter Gorman carrying out in order to remain employed and continue in his role?Jennifer Roberts (Democrat) and the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of County Commi...</body></row>

PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- Intoxicated by the fragrance of cedar chips and fresh dirt, visitors to the Rhode Island Spring Flower &amp; Garden Show floated from garden to garden on Friday, inhaling with their eyes as well as their lungs.

&quot;Timeless Gardens&quot; is the theme of the show that opened Thursday, with 21 full garden displays or vignettes, each interpreting a decade of history or the timelessness of nature. 

As in the 16 shows before it, the 2010 installation of the flower and garden show delivers spring to the winter weary -- a reminder that azaleas do exist, that snowdrops, crocuses, daffodils, forsythia and tulips are on their way.

The show is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Friday and Saturday, and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday in the Rhode Island Convention Center, One Sabin Street, Providence. Admission is $17 for adults, $15 for students and seniors, and $7 for children ages 6 to 12, with a $15 evening discount after 6 p.m.

The original version of this entry was posted at 3:36 p.m.</body></row>

<body>By Maria ArmentalPROVIDENCE, R.I. -- Providence will be host to the Council of State Governments' 2010 annual conference, officials announced Friday.

The four-day conference, which is expected to attract more than 800 officials from around the country, is scheduled to start Dec. 4 at the Rhode Island Convention Center. The Westin Providence hotel will be the base where most attendees will stay.

&quot;Providence is a convenient, accessible and affordable location for a large number of members who attend our conferences,&quot; South Dakota Gov. Mike Rounds, the group's current president, said in a news release. &quot;On top of that, Rhode Island has always been a most hospitable and welcoming state to us, and we look forward to enjoying our visit to the Ocean State.&quot;  

&quot;We are pleased to host a conference in Providence that will showcase our great city to governmental leaders from throughout the country,&quot; said House Speaker William J. Murphy. &quot;This will be an opportunity for conference participants to experience all that Providence has to offer, from our great restaurants and shops to our numerous arts and cultural activities.  We are grateful to CSG for choosing Providence and for allowing Rhode Island businesses to realize economic benefits during the conference period.&quot; 

The Council of State Governments serves all three branches of state government.</body></row>

<body>By Cynthia NeedhamPROVIDENCE, R.I. -- Advocates for health care, fair wages and union rights gathered Wednesday afternoon to demand that Congress create jobs and to pass a sensible health insurance plan.  

Their message to the Rhode Island delegation was not a new one, but it was impassioned: &quot;No Excuses. No more politics. Congress must act to create jobs and to pass strong health-care reform.&quot;

Speakers at the Kennedy Plaza rally, which drew about 100 people, also emphasized the need to protect workers' rights and address global warming.

&quot;We need Congress to pass a strong jobs-creation bill that will put Rhode Islanders and people across the country back to work,&quot; said Daniel Bass, organizer at the advocacy coalition Ocean State Action.

Participants urged Washington to recognize the stress that joblessness and a lack of affordable health care puts on working people who are just trying to stay afloat.

As one sign in the crowd put it: &quot;A job is a right.&quot;</body></row>

Show of the week goes to Americans in France and Whatever Brains, who will be at Nightlight on Friday with Invisible Hand and Naked Gods. (Photo of Americans in France, above, taken by Jordan Lawrence).?Also this week, at least two cool shows on Thursday, including Small Ponds, the new project with Caitlin Cary, at Tir na Nog, and The Lonely H at Slim's. I haven't seen The Small Ponds, but I've been told they're indie folk with great harmonies and hooks (thanks Alex). I have seen Washington state's Lonely H quite a few times, and basically they're a group of ?young guys perfectly recreating '70s anthemic rock.

<body>One of my oldest college buddy, Paris, was in town for the New Year and we decided to treat ourselves to the tasting menu at WD-50.   I know, you're thinking we're like 5 years too late on this, but whatevs, Wylie was in the kitchen cooking our food!Our bread basket turned out to be a wooden container of super thin sesame crisps that I'm sure were created using some sort of dehydrating machine with numbers in its name.  Deliciously crunchy and plentiful!  I was able to snack on these throughout the entire meal.   Thank you servers for not removing this from our table.  I hate when the bread basket is taken away.  Hey you, I'm not done with that!Amuse time!  Peekytoe crab, celery root, golden raisin and miso.  So tasty, I didn't even mind the raisin.This is the bottle of wine we had.  The restaurant is running a recession special of 50% off a bottle with the tasting menu, so this turned into a very good deal.Everything bagel ice cream with smoked salmon threads and crispy cream cheese.   This was brilliant - probably my favorite course of the night when take inventiveness into consideration with flavor.  The cream cheese had the texture of a thin sheet of white chocolate.  I made each bite a combo bite with a shard of cream cheese, sprinkling of smoked salmon and  portion of ice cream.Foie gras, passion fruit and Chinese celery two ways (thin shavings atop and crunchified at the base) .  This is view one.View two to show you the passion fruit innards.  I loved the crunch of the celery crumbles but  I think I'm just not a huge fan of passion fruit.  Too sweet for my tastes.  Still, a good accompaniment to the richness and unctuousness of the foie.Scrambled egg ravioli, charred avocado, seared kampachi and tiny, tiny home fries.  I love the way the chef balances textures.  Without the crispy potato bits, texture wise, this would have been too one dimensional a dish.Cold fried chicken with buttermilk-ricotta, tabasco reduction and caviar.  The ricotta was a great stand-in for rustic, mashed potatoes.Langoustine, red pepper threads, black sesame and shiso.Beef and bearnaise turned out to be nothing like what I was anticipating.  These were crazy rich but light as a feather bearnaise dumplings in a very beefy broth.   Silly me expected a piece of steak!Lamb loin, black garlic romesco, soybeans and pickled garlic chive.  This may have been my least favorite course of the evening.  The lamb was a bit undercooked for my tastes.  The silvery bit was left on the meat, making the chewy bites even chewier, nearly impossible to break down.&quot;Caramel apple&quot; was apple ice cream with caramel on the inside.Caramel apple insides.Hazelnut tart, coconut, chocolate and chicory foam.That's not a scallop!  It's a caramelized brioche with dried apricot, buttercream ribbon and lemon thyme foam dollops.To finish the evening, cocoa packets which reminded me of the old sample packs from Kiehl's and chocolate shortbread covered milk ice cream.</body></row>

<body>Making mozzarella at home is ridiculously easy, especially if you?ve got Kevlar hands. Mozzarella is a pasta-filata style of cheese which involves hand-stretching hot curds into pliable strands. Like pulling bread dough, the point is to manipulate it just enough to improve elasticity, but not so much as to toughen the thing.</body></row>

“Call me a joker, call me a foolRight at this moment I'm totally coolClear as a crystal, sharp as a knifeI feel like I'm in the prime of my lifeSometimes it feels like I'm going too fastI don't know how long this feeling will lastMaybe it's only tonight”-Billy Joel, I Go To Extremes
My business partner and best friend Josh always tells me that I have an extreme personality. If I drink, I drink a lot. If I eat, I eat a lot. If I am angry, I am very angry and if I’m happy, I’m very happy. You get the picture. Whatever the emotion, the person, or the project, it is all encompassing. What is the point of doing something unless you are going to go all the way with it??? 
My life has always followed this path of extremes. My mother pushed me to be a good student when I was younger, so then school was all encompassing. In my junior year of high school I memorized thousands of words and definitions for the SATs and spent countless hours with a tutor. When it was said and done, I got a respectable 1400 on the test, got into Cornell’s Hotel School, and that was it – I officially checked out from the world of academia. That summer I headed to Los Angeles to work as a cook in Wolfgang Puck’s original Spago on Sunset Boulevard. Through my friend Danny Zelouf and my co-worker Jesus, I discovered forties of Olde English and next applied my extreme personality to Malt Liquor… West Side till I die. I recall showing up to work in Spago’s kitchen with my first real hangover and puking in the sink. I swore off alcohol for the first time, but it wouldn’t be the last…?? 
My odyssey of excess continued from L.A. to Cornell, an incredible school located in the most boring city in America. The most exciting thing about Ithaca was the supermarket, a gourmand’s dream, Wegmans.? The store was a food heaven way ahead of its time, filled with specialty items, ethnic food sections, and an incredible café full of delectable sandwiches, pastas, sushi rolls, and butchers that would grill the meat right in front of you. During this phase of my life, I started many of my extreme food journeys at Wegmans, including searches for the hottest peppers on the pepper chart, chipotles, to feed raw to my fraternity pledges during hazing. There is joy in watching grown men cry. 
I remember one cold and snowy Saturday evening in Ithaca when I had nothing really planned. With my Jewish Latina girlfriend in toe (what a find), I went to Wegmans and picked up a case of Coors Light, a baguette, a half pound of prosciutto, and a hunk of the fattiest Brie available. The sea was angry that day my friend, like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli. As my girlfriend watched with childlike disbelief, I polished off the lusciously decadent melting Brie at about beer number nine, and the last slice of prosciutto at around 13. As my mind said yes, my arteries said no, but like Brett Favre and an interception, for better or for worse, there was no stopping me from my ultimate goal. 
I am now 30 years old and not much has changed. Last Friday in Miami I once again woke up hungover and in extremist fashion ordered the Blueprint Cleanse for commencement upon my return to New York. The Blueprint is a six-juice-per-day cleanse that is delivered to your house. You drink those juices for a set amount of days and it cleanses your system – in my case, of everything I did that past weekend.? I cleansed from Sunday night until Thursday morning, erasing almost seven pounds (probably mostly water), clearing my head, and creating an uncontrollable craving for delicious food and drinks. As is the case, one extreme leads to another and at 7 p.m. on Thursday I was raring to go, so I started by meeting my friend, Eric Goldberg for drinks at Hundred Acres in SoHo. I eagerly anticipated my first Belvedere on the rocks with three olives. As Will Ferrell said in Old School, “Once it hits your lips, it’s so good!” Maybe he wasn’t kidding or maybe he was, but either way I was back on the gravy train and ready for the weekend. After a plate of meatballs with tomato sauce over a bed of po...</body></row>

<body>By Meredith DelisoMost drama in basketball happens on the court. For the ladies of the Bed-Stuy Bulls, it’s in the locker room.“Shoot 2 Win” follows a day in the life of seven friends who play on a competitive league as they try to reach for the gold in a city-wide tournament. But between cheating husbands and drug abuse, basketball’s the last thing on their minds. Donna Marie Augustin originally saw the production in her native London, and wanted to bring it to Brooklyn, where she’s lived in Bedford-Stuyvesant for the past three years.“I literally sat there with my mouth open,” says Augustin of the original show. “I thought it was a really beautiful piece. You don’t get to see all-female, African American women. I always knew I was going to produce it.”In putting on the show for an American audience, the script, written by Jo Martin, Josephine Melville and Tracey Daley, needed some “translation.” Netball, which the original focused on, became basketball. Obscure British/Caribbean slang (“Stop talking stupidness”) was reworked, with help from Brooklyn writer and director Nelson George (whom Augustin worked with on the forthcoming film “Left Unsaid”). But the story remained the same.As soon as the lights go on, the women enter the locker room one by one, each carrying their own demons – Shenequa (played by Augustin) and her drug dealing on the side; Jackie and her alcoholism; Carrie and her bad luck with men; Mandy and her drug abuse; Zoe and her racial identity crisis; Bev and her faith; and Sandra, who has the biggest weight to carry of them all. Despite the severity of their problems, the play does have its light-hearted moments as well, including an impromptu dance sequence and clever dialogue. But, thanks to heated words between the friends and serious soliloquies from each actress, the play strives to uncover those truths that are right below the surface, and on the tip of everyone’s tongue. Off the court, they’re still on the defense.Besides the script, another draw for Augustin was the opportunity to have an all-female, nearly all-black ensemble piece.“Most black female parts are social workers, nurses, prostitutes, a mother who’s either an ex-druggy or suffering,” says Augustin. “This is specifically an all female cast with all great, well-written characters who are black women who are interesting. For me it was about that. My goal is to get that to be the vernacular of the theater.”After a few days at the Cherry Lane Theatre in Manhattan, the production comes to Brooklyn’s Kumble Theater for the Performing Arts March 3-7. Tickets are $22, $15 for students, seniors and groups of 10 or more. The theater is located at 1 University Plaza. For more information,  call 718-488-1624.</body></row>

<body>DATELINE FEB. 24, 2010:  QUEENS CRAP ROVING REPORTER CLAIRE SHULMAN SUPPORTING ANOTHER LAND GRAB BY DEVELOPERSI’ve attended many a dog-&amp;-pony show before, but look at what came out of the chute at the Flushing BID rodeo held at Flushing’s Sheraton East hotel:  our bovine ex-BEEP Claire Shulman.  From her appearance in these photos, she looks like she was pulled out of mothballs or some critical meeting with her Willets Point LDC cohorts.  Shulman attended, along with some of the other usual suspects, to support Wellington Chen and his pals over at TDC as they presented to the public their over-development plan for Municipal Parking Lot #1 in downtown Flushing, Flushing Commons.  Could this appearance have been a condition for Shulman receiving her “Wellington Welfare?”   Is she not earning about a quarter of a million dollars a year lobbying for the Willets Point land grab project?  Is she not often pictured with Wellington Chen, who’s closely allied to development companies TDC, F&amp;T, Fultonex, etc?  Hmmm, I’d like some of that welfare, too, when I’m put out to pasture.  She clearly learned her lessons at the knee of mentor Donald Manes, and they pay well, too.  In their continuing effort to destroy the quality of life in New York City, the Bloomberg administration is now selling off this public parking lot to TDC, a private developer.  TDC’s proposed private project is massive, dense, tall, oppressive, and quite dated in design.  It will include upscale shopping, upscale condos, upscale offices but no movie theater for you masses to attend, even though it was previously required and promised.    Michael Meyer of TDC, also representing the Rockefeller Group, made the presentation.  He seemed pretty cocky to start with, speaking to a business audience (plus reporters, of course).  This reporter suspects he expected a sympathetic audience.  Far from it!  Concerns were raised about parking, Mom-&amp;-Pop businesses being put out of business by the construction &amp; eventual competition in Flushing Commons, truck delivery traffic, safety, etc.    The following evening-- Wednesday, Feb. 24-- CB7 held a committee meeting on the parking aspect of the project with the developers, with Meyers presenting again.  The original deal required capping the low muni parking rates in perpetuity, but that seems to have gone by the board, along with the requirement for adequate parking spaces.   Long term parking will be going to Willets Point.  And don’t ask about parking during actual construction-- how many blocks do you want to walk from your car to stores or subway?  Hey, the exercise is good for you!I have a shorter version from another QC fan:&quot;The presenter for TDC/Rockefeller lost his cool at both presentations and treated the audience like mentally-impaired cows.&quot;Well, we can see that there was at least one in attendance.</body></row>

<body>Kunur Patel and Brad Johnson, AdAge.com - Interpublic Group of Cos. has slipped to the fourth-largest slot among advertising agency holding companies, as confirmed in its fourth-quarter earnings release this morning.Interpublic, parent to agency networks including McCann Erickson and DraftFCB, reported revenue of $6.0 billion for 2009, down 13.4%, which pulls the holding company behind Publicis Groupe.Interpublic full-year net income attributable to the company fell 58.9% to $121.3 million, and fourth-quarter earnings attributable to Interpublic dropped 37.1% to $136.4 million year over year. Interpublic saw the most dramatic decline in full-year revenue compared to Publicis and Omnicom Group reports.Publicis, which houses the likes of agency networks Leo Burnett and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and media company Starcom MediaVest Group, is now the No. 3 holding company behind WPP and Omnicom, with $6.3 billion in full-year revenue, a 8.9% decline from 2008.Publicis numbers were buoyed by an estimated $100 million in fourth-quarter revenue from Razorfish, which the Paris-based company acquired in October from Microsoft to build out its digital stable that already includes the highest-revenue-generating digital agency in the U.S. for 2008, Digitas.&quot;Looking at the quarter, the organic revenue decline of 8.2% represented a sequential improvement from the previous six months,&quot; said Interpublic Chief Executive Michael Roth, according to a call statement. &quot;We've consistently been clear that we think the worst of the recession's impact on our business is past.&quot;Mr. Roth echoes Omnicom CEO John Wren, who, during a call reporting his company's double-digit profit decline, said advertising has made it through the worst of the current recession.&quot;Economic conditions appear to have stabilized, and we believe that we should see improvement during the course of 2010,&quot; Mr. Roth said, adding that business is optimistic for the second half of the year. Interpublic saw a 10.8% organic decrease for the full year.The fourth-place ranking for Interpublic is not a surprise -- Publicis was ahead at the nine-month mark -- but the full-year figures lock in the position.Interpublic, the original agency holding company, ranked No. 1 as recently as 2000. It slipped to second, behind Omnicom, in 2001, and third, behind WPP, in 2003. WPP took the top spot in 2008, after acquiring market-research firm Taylor Nelson Sofres. A media correlate is Time Warner, which was the nation's biggest media company in 2000 and is now No. 4 after spinning off Time Warner Cable and AOL.WPP will report results March 5.</body></row>

It has stores incorporated into its ground floor, and many of the same kinds of decorative Deco reliefs and lettering.  Forever tied to the bank, physically and stylistically, this block front is an ironic joining of God and Mammon. GMAP</body></row>

<body>Recently, Lost City Brooks posted some photos of a fruit-drink stand in Times Square, via the blog Aaron Signs. The fruit-drink stand was called Elpine Drinks and it stood on 46th St. and 7th Ave. I've been trying to dig up information on Elpine for a few years, ever since seeing it for the first time in the movie Sweet Smell of Success.It's the place where Tony Curtis, as press agent Sidney Falco, goes to grab a late-night hot dog and a juice in a conical paper cup, to check the newspapers and make his important phone calls.According to the menu in the background, cream-cheese sandwiches were 15 cents and you could get a malted milk for a dime. But that, and the information posted by Brooks and Aaron, clipped from a 1969 New York Magazine, is all I know about Elpine. Otherwise, it's like this odd little chain never existed.1955 photo via LileksStill, I like to think about going in there--under the smoke rings of the Camel sign, with the racket of an upstairs billiard parlor breaking through an open window, on a hot summer day, drinking fresh-squeezed juice from a paper cone in a stainless steel holder...which, by the way, you can still enjoy today at the Lexington Candy Shop.Update: Thanks to commenter Alana for pointing us to this 1943 panoramic photo at Shorpy--here's the Elpine detail (with girls in gloves and bobby socks):Photo: John Vachon</body></row>

<body>On the surface, the seven-hour, 30-minute marathan policy debate on health care reform may have not produced much beyond showing a live TV audience that the gulf between Democrats and Republicans couldn't be wider.Even President Obama said as much. &quot;We cannot have another yearlong debate about this,&quot; he said at the end of the summit, adding that he is unsure the Democrats can &quot;bridge the gap&quot; with the GOP to reach a compromise.Despite the apparent setback, many observers rated the session as a success for the president while others crowed at the perceived failure of the very public talks:     - The Washington Post's Chris Cillizza included Obama among his list of &quot;Winners&quot; from the summit. &quot;What Obama did do was paint himself -- for anyone who was watching -- as someone genuinely interested in compromise and genuinely interested in engaging with his Republican colleagues,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Obama's performance saved, to our mind, what could have been a disastrous day for his party as he got relatively little help from his party's representatives in Congress throughout the day.&quot;     - Reuters' Caren Bohan put her magnifying glass on Obama's demeanor, noting that this was an unfiltered and long look at the president's &quot;management style.&quot; &quot;His tone was at times professorial, occasionally combative and at one point even dismissive of his 2008 rival for the presidency, Republican Senator John McCain,&quot; she wrote.      - The Atlantic's Clive Crook gave Obama high marks -- but he argued that it was a failure nonetheless. &quot;In a difficult role, Obama did well. But the Republicans (not counting John Boehner) did well too--much better than I would have guessed. They came across as serious and respectful,&quot; he wrote. &quot;The aim today was to discipline and energize Obama's allies, and to weaken and embarrass the Republicans. It backfired. This turned out to be a good day for the GOP.&quot;     - At The Corner, a blog on the conservative site National Review, Daniel Foster simply noted the stats. &quot;According to Senate Republicans, President Obama spoke for 119 minutes, other Democrats for 114 minutes, and Congressional Republicans for 110 minutes,&quot; he wrote in a post titled &quot;The Unforgiving Minutes&quot; suggesting that Obama's performance was perhaps a little too heavy.     - Politico's Glenn Thrush wrote that there was no clear winner in the &quot;gabfest,&quot; but argued Obama &quot;wasn?t able to dominate them like he did last month during an encounter with House Republicans in Baltimore, when he delivered zingers high above the GOP from a conference room podium.&quot; Citing operatives on both sides of the aisle, Thrush writes &quot;the tie goes to Republicans.&quot;</body></row>

<body>Hey guys let's eat some rabbit!!: At Bar Tartine tonight some chefs are doing a special menu serving rabbit four ways. FOUR WAYS! Even better, “a portion of the proceeds” will benefit Haiti! Holy shit let’s get over there and eat some fucking rabbit. It’s only $100 per ticket, plus you can make all these great puns while you’re enjoying the delicious flavors of Nibbler’s, Bells’ and Nuage’s cousins.
In related news, this weekend in Norway the roof of a building collapsed, killings lots of the rabbits that were inside for the show. What did we learn? That saying “bunny” instead of “rabbit” makes tragedy HILARIOUS, OH MAN, thanks Deadspin.
I know I’ve said this before, and if you’re following a veg diet you’re in the clear, but for everyone else, come the fuck on. Rabbits are for petting; not eating, not hunting, not bashing in the head and making into coats. It’s entirely unnecessary to eat bunnies; seriously, you first-world fuckers have zero excuse for killing an animal so clever and cute and marvelously fun to be around (they’re as friendly as cats, and they won’t scratch or bite you or infect you with awful diseases). So KNOCK IT OFF, already. I’m forming a prey-animal army—pigeons are the first volunteers!—and we’re coming for you heartless bastards.</body></row>

                    New research is exposing a housing problem in Milwaukee that?s rarely reported. It?s  the story of renter evictions. They?re up, and they?re hitting one group particularly hard. 1 out of 20 Milwaukee renters will be thrown to the curb this year. 
 
28-year-old Angela Sandifer struggles to hold onto her home. &quot;I was facing eviction...Sometimes when you gotta pay your bills and your money don?t meet up you gotta rob Peter for Paul.&quot; 
 
The single mother of four fell behind on her $950 a month rent, and was threatened with eviction. &quot;I?m pretty much going to be in a shelter with my kids.&quot; 
 
Her?s is the part of the untold story of the housing crisis. University of Wisconsin researchers say we know a lot about foreclosures, because the victims are established property owners. The public rarely hears about renters. 
 
The eviction numbers are much higher amongst black singe mothers. Black women make up about 13% of the city?s population, but 40% of the city?s evictions. Apartment Association of Southeastern Wisconsin Attorney Heiner Giese says, &quot;I?m not convinced it?s a racial thing. It?s a question of poverty...The problem is that evictions hurt not just people being evicted. They hurt the landlords, because people can?t pay their mortgage.&quot; 
 
Sandifer just started a new part-time job, and she?s working out a day to pay back rent money she owes. 
 
A University of Wisconsin Sociologist says the disruptive effects of eviction are the female equivalent of incarceration. Of more than 50,000 evictions analyzed over five years, 60% were women.</body></row>

<body>The Urban Meadow team is in the early stages of setting up a CSA (community supported agriculture program) at the garden and would like to get a sense of how many community members would be interested in participating.If you'd be interested in participating in a local CSA, please contact me at cbarker1 {at} gmail.com.  We need a certain level of interest shown in order to be able to officially set it up.** You would not need to be a member of the Urban Meadow to participate in a CSA there, and expressing interest in participation does not imply your commitment at this time.Don't know what a CSA is?  Check out the description provided by Just Food below:CSA allows city residents to have direct access to high quality, fresh produce grown locally by regional farmers.   When you become a member of a CSA, you’re purchasing a “share” of vegetables from a regional farmer. Weekly or bi-weekly, from June until October or November, your farmer will deliver that share of produce to a convenient drop-off location in your neighborhood.CSA members pay for an entire season of produce upfront (typically $400-$600). This early bulk payment enables your farmer to plan for the season, purchase new seed, make equipment repairs, and more.    Shares usually include 7-10 types of vegetables, enough for a family of 2-3 people. Most CSAs also offer half shares for smaller households or busy New Yorkers who frequently eat out.   Many CSAs also offer the option of other produce from local farms. For a few extra dollars a week, in addition to your vegetables, you can add fruit, eggs, meat, and even flowers to your order.

Yes, there's something promising about walking into a room full of &quot;a bunch of dudes kicked back, just trying to take the edge off,&quot; one &quot;small-batch organic pint at time,&quot; up until it becomes painfully &quot;reminiscent of walking in on your little brother's slumber party in the family den.&quot; You just know that as soon as you leave they'll all be high fiving that they &quot;totally saw some nip, dude.&quot; Short of that, this crowd is happy to ignore you and spend some &quot;serious QT with a pretzel, an iphone, a buddy and some cask-conditioned IPA.&quot; Whatever that is.

<body>Bianca Jagger could owe as much as $438,000 in fees and back rent as the result of losing her five-year battle to keep her rent-regulated apartment at 530 Park Avenue, attorneys representing the landlord said. 

A hearing in New York State Supreme Court is scheduled for Monday to begin the process to determine how much Jagger, the former wife of singer Mick Jagger, owes after losing her fight to retain the rent-stabilized unit in the building at Park Avenue between 60th and 61st streets in late 2008. 

The legal fees for landlord Katz Park Avenue are believed to amount to over $200,000 and what she owes in rent for the period she remained in the unit after her lease expired was estimated at $238,000, attorney Jeffrey Goldman, a partner at Belkin Burden Wenig &amp; Goldman who is representing the landlord, said in an e-mail. The back rent was based on a monthly charge of $7,000. 

Jagger was evicted from the unit in December 2007, court records show.</body></row>

<body>Despite having one of the best orchestras in the world right here at home, it was a treat to hear the Leipzig Gewandhaus orchestra in Davies Symphony Hall. The LGO, founded in 1743, is one of the oldest and most revered orchestras in the world. It has been led by Felix Mendelssohn, Wilhelm Furtw?ngler, Bruno Walter; it has performed all Beethoven symphonies while the composer was still alive, and brought the Seventh back to life on Monday night.  

We plumped down in our seat, and there was something different we could not pinpoint right away, like being in a forest without the birds chirping: the musicians were not warming up, tuning, nor practicing the hairy parts of their program in that messy, random cacophony which usually precedes the entrance of the maestro. Actually, the musicians were not even on stage: they entered all together to take a bow and receive a round of applause. It was a display of German organization which repeated after intermission, but mostly it was good showmanship, putting the spotlight straight on the orchestra.  		 			 				 	 	 	The maestro, Ricardo Chailly., and the soloist, Louis Lortie came out of the wing, and put together a masterful, vibrant rendition of Beethoven's piano concerto No. 5 (Emperor). Herbert Blomstedt, who was music director of both the SF Symphony and the LGO, was comparing the American and European sound in a conversation with us, and the LGO made the difference clear:  warmer strings, a greater fluidity, a smoother sound, greater cohesion. The LGO sounded even better here than the Berlin Philharmonic which paid a visit recently (granted, in a different program). 

The togetherness of the orchestra, the even balance of the sound totally impressed us. The pianist did his best to blend, but was an exogenous component nonetheless. It's like being friend with twins: you can hang out, you can have a good time, but your relationship will be less symbiotic than between them. And Lortie was a bit too subdued. It's rare to hear the piano overwhelmed by strings.

Louis Lortie found his stride in the softest, most delicate moments. He was technically pretty darn good, but maybe not as resolute as the piece demands. The rondo in particular is a beast. It transitions almost innocently from the previous adagio, where the pianist plays the theme of the next movement very slowly. It's like going up splash mountain: the theme will repeat in a flurry of chords at breakneck pace, and there is a sense of dread (for the pianist) and expectation (for the audience) until the canoe tips off over the edge for the fun ride. Lortie did make the most of it, and the audience requested, and received, an encore. 

The second half displayed the orchestra's quality in Beethoven's Seventh Symphony. They were set for the concert in a different layout from the local band, with the violins split on each side of the stage: a particularly good decision due to the swirling quality of the sound and the interplay Beethoven puts in the violin parts. Also, we want these brass.</body></row>

<body>Thx for the recommendation.  I tried two macarons from the Sandbox Bakery this week (one strawberry lavender and one espresso) and thought the flavors were okay but the texture was completely off.  Both macarons were very soft, almost to the point of being soggy, and there was no bite at all.  No thin, crispy shell, no light and fluffy inside.  

I also noticed the macarons were a bit cold when I first got them, so while I had one right away, I ate the other one three hours later.  Unfortunately that didn't make a difference--the texture was just not there.

That said, these macarons were still much better than the horrible ones at Patisserie Phillippe.  I went there this week as well and hated their macarons.  Not as atrocious as the ones from Pamplemousse in San Mateo (those are still the worst ones I've ever tasted in my life) but still pretty bad.  First of all, the macarons were still in a refrigerated state, which spoils the texture, and the whole thing was so chewy I thought I was biting into an American peanut/chocolate candy bar.

Paulettes is still the best in the bay area.</body></row>

<body>Against the white backdrop of a very snowy February evening, all the stars of the new Matt Damon action movie Green Zone arrived at last night's Cinema Society and Universal Pictures-sponsored screening dressed in black. &quot;I have the same outfit for premieres and funerals,&quot; said co-star Jason Isaacs (most recently of Harry Potter fame), who was sporting a Jaeger suit (black) and matching shirt. &quot;You know what it is, you feel like you've gotta wear something close to a tux,&quot; said British actor Khalid Abdalla when asked whether the stars had coordinated wardrobes before the premiere. Abdalla plays an Iraqi translator who works alongside Damon's character, an American soldier on the hunt for WMDs in Iraq. The Brit's black Gucci suit, Dolce &amp; Gabbana shirt, and Prada shoes were a marked step up from his Green Zone wardrobe: &quot;I was in nothing stylish for this film. The only potentially stylish thing I had was a mustache.&quot; After two hours of ear-battering explosions, the crowd decamped to Nobu 57, where Julia Stiles, Maria Bartiromo, and more than a few NBC execs fortified themselves against the blizzard howling outside. At the center of it all was Damon, the toast of the evening, in a natty three-piece suit?black, of course.—D.M. Levine</body></row>

<body>In case we forgot, some of the Hollywood actresses who descend on New York fashion week also have a day job: i.e., selling movie tickets. Demi Moore was able to combine business and pleasure over the last couple of days, making a front-row appearance at Donna Karan on Monday and attending the Cinema Society-hosted premiere of her film Happy Tears at the MoMA last night. &quot;That was just for fun,&quot; Moore said of supporting her friend Karan. &quot;This is work?not that I'm complaining about my job or anything!&quot; For this particular gig, Moore plays Laura, one of two sisters?the other is portrayed by Parker Posey?who come back to the family home to assess the health of their father (Rip Torn). Not to give too much of the plot away, but more than one person remarked on the appropriateness of the casting of perennial off-screen naughty boy Torn. After the screening, the crew moved to the uptown outpost of Mr. Chow. The place was packed, and with seating only available for the cast, many guests received an impromptu lesson on how to eat messy gourmet Chinese food on their feet. &quot;As a model, you get really good at it,&quot; Angela Lindvall explained. &quot;And we're good at standing in heels all night.&quot; It was the second skill that Posey could have used; toward the end of the night, she plunked herself down at a table and kicked off her stilettos. &quot;These shoes are not nearly as comfortable as the ones I wear in the film,&quot; she said, referring to an important prop in the movie. &quot;But don't spoil that for anybody?they'll have to see the movie themselves!&quot; After fashion week, of course.  A few blocks over, on Fifth Avenue, fashion was mingling with some other movie types. Martin Scorsese, Isabella Rossellini, and Leonardo DiCaprio will be at the premiere of Shutter Island tonight, but first, Roberta Armani wanted to host a cocktail party for them at Armani Ristorante. As is often the case when it comes to the Armani group and Hollywood heavyweights, there was a family feel: &quot;Martin and Mr. Armani have known each other for many years,&quot; said Roberta, adding that Shutter Island &quot;really is an example of Martin at the top of his game.&quot; Another one to put on our viewing list?post-fashion week, that is.—Derek Blasberg</body></row>

<body>The moment I stepped into lower Manhattan's City Winery I knew that this would be a fitting venue for the show I was about to experience.  The venue boasts a large open space filled with long tables, as well as a bar off to the side and an elevated area in the back with more seating.  The space is artistic but mellow and its wood accents paired with dim lighting make it warm and cozy. Emo-folk singer Chris Garneau was joined on the small stage by a trumpet, trombone, violin, and cello which together created a mini symphony of elaborate and intoxicating sound.  The crowd sat still in awe sipping their wine and it was fascinating to see how the performance captured every face in this dark, mellow room.  The overall tone was on the somber side and some songs were reminiscent of death including the one that he dedicated to his mother.  Some of the highlights of Garneau's performance were &quot;Baby's Romance&quot; and the hit from his 2009 sophomore album El Radio &quot;Fireflies.&quot;  The breathy ballad &quot;Over and Over&quot; seduced fans with &quot;we're rockers anyway, just skin and bones/good hair, good clothes/and that's how it goes.&quot; The stage was handed over to rocker Joseph Arthur, a musician discovered by Peter Gabriel in the mid-90s, who started with &quot;Echo Park,&quot; a catchy ode to freedom.  &quot;Can't Exist&quot; included an exhilarating electric guitar riff at the end.  Chris joined in on the piano for &quot;September Baby&quot; and several other songs including &quot;Honey and the Moon,&quot; a romantic lullaby singing &quot;if you weren't real I'd make you up.&quot;  While most of Arthur's songs were calm, he impressed with his musical multi-tasking, mixing his vocals with guitar, harmonica, and even pre-recorded guitar riffs which he strategically turned on throughout his set to replace the band he did not have.  &quot;Exhausted,&quot; &quot;Black Lexus,&quot; and &quot;She Paints Me Gold&quot; were a few of the last songs in his set that the crowd were all equally enamored with. Both acts together created a captivating show and made it worth the $14 glasses of wine that were so easy to sip while listening to these intensely lyrical and slow mesmerizing songs.Kate Hollinger</body></row>

As they explore sexual identity, challenge racism, experiment with drugs and burn draft cards, the &quot;tribe&quot; in Hair creates an irresistible message of hope that continues to resonate with audiences 40 years later.</body></row>

<body>Who'd have imagined 15 years ago, when you'd have been hard-pressed to find a real Sichuan restaurant in New York, that a single block of W. 39th St., between 5th &amp; 6th Avenues, would be host to two of the best and most authentic Sichuan restaurants in all of New York City?It started 2004, when Szechuan Gourmet, a Flushing restaurant, opened a Manhattan outpost on the block.  I first tried it in 2006.  True Sichuan cooking had returned to Manhattan in the '90s, with the Grand Sichuan and Wu Liang Ye mini-chains.  While I found some dishes at Grand Sichuan to be excellent, Wu Liang Ye always seemed to be a notch or two up.  Then Szechuan Gourmet came along, and it was clearly in the same league as Wu Liang Ye.Lan Sheng, at 60 W. 39th, opened late last year on the same block as Szechuan Gourmet.  It's possible that this was deliberate.  Szechuan Gourmet had become extremely popular after a Frank Bruni two-star review in the Times in 2008 (no doubt following the leads of enthusiastic foodies on sites like Chowhound).  Szechuan Gourmet is always crowded at lunch and often at dinner, so perhaps the Lan Sheng owners hoped to attract diners who weren't up for a long wait.  In any case, with the opening of Lan Sheng, which I'd say is in the same class as the best of Manhattan's Sichuan restaurants (granted, based on one meal, but with a large-enough sampling), let me be the first to give the block the honorary name &quot;Little Chengdu.&quot;I think when dealing with the top echelon of restaurants in any regional Chinese cuisine the question isn't which is the best but rather which dishes are best at which place.  And in many cases it boils down to a matter of preference among two good but different versions of the same dish.  For me Lan Sheng seemed to shine especially in the seafood department.One of our favorite dishes was the sea scallops with yibin yacai spice (photo at top).  On the menu the dish features prawns, but we were told they were all out of prawns (very odd at 7PM on a weeknight, I must say).  But the scallops were absolutely fresh, plump and delicious.  Yibin yacai is a kind of pickled vegetable mixed with minced pork that is stir fried with shrimp or string beans usually, and is a specialty of Yibin city in Sichuan province.Perhaps even better were the fish cubes with pickled chilies.  This may be a Hunan rather than a Sichuan dish (I don't normally see pickled chilies on Sichuan menus, but they were all over the menu at Flushing's Hunan House).  Abundant cubes of tilapia filet were served in a sauce that had a complex flavor, hard to pin down completely, of which the pickled chilies were but one component.  The dish is very, but not overwhelmingly, spicy.  I don't believe it features Sichuan peppercorns, so it doesn't have that mentholated tingle of some of the other dishes, and therefore provides a nice flavor balance to a meal.Gui Zhou chicken  is a spicy dish I know from the Grand Sichuan restaurants, where the chicken chunks are served on the bone.  At Lan Sheng it's boneless and somewhat less spicy.  Very good in its way, but this is one dish that I think is the real star at Grand Sichuan.Lan Sheng's camphor tea smoked duck was outstanding, just a cut below the version at Wu Liang Ye, which I consider the gold standard.  The skin was crispy, and the meat was sweet and tender with most excess fat cooked out.  I prefer this to the fattier, less crispy version across the street at Szechuan Gourmet.But the lamb with cumin, served here with a moist, spicy cumin paste, was no match for Szechuan Gourmet's dry, crispy version.Though most Sichuan restaurants serve cold dishes with chili vinaigrette, I don't believe I've seen it with scungilli elsewhere.  Ultimately, I think this preparation fares better with meat, especially ox tongue and tripe, a common Sichuan menu item.Lan Sheng's version of dan dan noodles is a bit unorthodox.  I don't think I've ever had the dish with crushed peanuts before, and the sauce was thicker and sweeter than most, with less of a Sichuan peppercorn kick.  I wasn't thrilled.If you've been to ...</body></row>

<body>Something horrible is happening to me. It's called Sex Rehab with Dr. Drew. I can't get enough of this freaking train wreck. This is not the first addiction based reality show. Intervention, Sober House, and Drew's own Celebrity Rehab, helped blaze the trail that led to this. Perhaps these were entertaining and worthy shows, but I was not compelled to watch a minute of them. But this one covers a subject near and dear to my heart. Here they come, traipsing mock-reluctantly into the Pasadena Recovery Center, if such a place even exists. The surfer dude, the porn star, the rocker, the model, the disgraced beauty queen. All claiming that their out of control libidos are ruining their lives. Is wanting to 'fuck anything that moves' comparable to having a need to tie off and shoot heroin? As far as I know there aren't any chemicals added to bodily fluids to enhance their addictive properties. Some days I want to fuck anything that moves too, and I am not a sex addict.What makes the show hard to dismiss out of hand is all the helping. It really is a new kind of porn, with tears as the cumshot. While one might question whether having oneself filmed crying, jonesing for cock and pussy and confessing to all manner of truly disturbing abuse is a wise choice, one cannot deny the impact of hearing these horror stories and watching as the patients become more in touch with their emotions, form bonds of friendship with fellow addicts and learn to trust their fake therapists. Another TV shrink, Dr Phil has based his career on this kind of public shaming. It can only go so far in terms of actual progress, but it's better than nothing. Of course reality shows are a perfect way to gain attention without actually having any talent other than knowing how to get the camera to pay attention to you. (Hint: call someone a &quot;jealous transvestite-looking bitch&quot; as Kari Ann Peniche did to Kendra Jade Rossi.)If these &quot;sex addicts&quot; are getting better, it's not because they are learning how to quit something, like cigarettes, alcohol, drugs. They are getting better because of therapy. Therapy will perhaps enable them to make better partner choices and allow them to be more emotionally open with the people around them. You can't quit sex. But you can become more honest about what you need and what no-longer works for you. You can outgrow behavior that only serves to tear you down. You can feel differently about your actions, even if you're not happy with them. As Kendra Jade says &quot;I'm not in a position to heal when I'm being attacked.&quot; She's learning a recovery language we all speak now. It sounds at once empty and full of promise.Alternate show titles: So You Think You Can Fuck, America's Got Talented Porn Stars, I'm a Compulsive Masturbator, Get Me Out of Here.Dan Siegler</body></row>

<body>For the first time ever, an artist has bought a Rockefeller. 
  Artist Jeff Koons, famed for his giant balloon-animal sculptures, has snatched up for an eye-popping $20 million a palatial Upper East Side townhouse from a member of the family renowned for its patronage of the arts, sources say. 
  The 10,000-square-foot mansion at 13 E. 67th St. was the longtime home of the late Barbara &quot;Bobo&quot; Rockefeller, who turned its lavish interior -- with 19-foot ceilings, a squash court and a pool -- into a must-visit stop on New York's society circuit for decades. 
  But Koons has his work cut out for him, as the home has been vacant since 2005 and is in &quot;complete disrepair,&quot; sources said. 
  &quot;It looked like a very 'Gray Gardens' type of place,&quot; said a person who has recently been inside. &quot;It's a great place, but very run down.&quot; 
  Koons, 55, whose works have sold for tens of millions of dollars, already owns the townhouse next door, which he bought last year for $12 million, but will need to do millions of dollars in renovations before he'd be able to join the two. 
  Rockefeller, who died at age 91 in 2008, was not typical of the family whose name is synonymous with old money and supporting the arts. 
  A coal miner's daughter born Jievute Paulekiute, Bobo married into the clan after meeting Winthrop Rockefeller -- a future governor of Arkansas and brother of former New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller -- in 1948. Seven months later, the couple had a son, Winthrop Jr. 
  The marriage didn't last, and their 1951 break-up became a tabloid dream. She accused Winthop of being a womanizing drunk with a vast collection of pornography. 
  &quot;I want him to suffer the way he has made me suffer; as he has humiliated me before the world,&quot; Bobo told reporters. &quot;I intend to be a Mrs. Rockefeller until the day I die.&quot; 
  Not only did she take the Rockefeller name, she walked off with a $5.5 million divorce settlement -- then a record-setting sum -- which she used to buy the mansion. 
  She remained there for decades.
